Evanston, IL	Umut Soysal	$1,945,510	$2,400,000	149.0	(Please scroll down for English and other languages)https://www.instagram.com/gokalp_sma/https://www.facebook.com/gokalpsma/https://twitter.com/kucuk_gokalpYou can be a hope for Gökalp! I have initiated this charity campaign for Gökalp who is the only son of Sefa and Yelda Küçük. Gökalp has Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 2 disease.Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease that disable people by affecting the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, taking away the ability to walk, eat, or breathe. It is the number one genetic cause of death for infants.There is an approved gene therapy, which is called Zolgensma. It costs (together with hospital expenses) 2,4 million USD (for only babies below 2 years old) in USA.Only with this treatment, Gökalp can walk. He is now 1.5 years old and he is racing against time.Thank you very much for your all support.Below I share the history of Küçük Family As all parents wish, our only dream was to hold our baby in our arms after we learned that we would have a child. And that big day had come for us, while we were waiting to meet him in excitement, our little Gökalp was about to confront his first fight in life . Before we had even touched his tiny hands and smelled his beautiful odor, he had to struggle for life in the intensive care incubator, but we knew that he would handle this since he was our child--he would do more and there were many ways for us to walk together as a family. Fortunately, our prayers were honored and after a week in intensive care incubator our Gökalp won his first fight in life with his small body but huge heart. And that moment had come, our baby was in our arms … And after that, it was time to realize the dreams we had while waiting for him ….When our Gökalp was 3 months old, we instinctively started to feel that there was something wrong with our baby, and after that, our adventure with doctors started. We had visited so many doctors and we had so many sleepless nights with full of anxiety, but we also believed that these would pass, and that our child would overcome no matter what. However, when he was only 11 months old, unfortunately we have learned of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).SMA disease is a genetic muscle disease that affects motor nerve cells in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, limiting its mobility. Since the SMN gene in the anterior horn cells is defective due to this disease, the motor nerve cells cannot produce the protein they need and eventually the motor neurons begin to die. As a result, unfortunately, the body becomes unable to move its voluntary muscles and these muscles begin to atrophy.Gökalp could no longer run, walk or even eat at the further stages of this disease. You may not even want to think about how this makes a parent feel. What was our sin, how has our Gökalp come to be in the grip of such a disease? He was a little baby and most importantly, innocent… It was very difficult for us to accept this disease, there was only one question in our minds that we asked ourselves thousands of times: Why…Our doctors said that there is a gene treatment called 'Zolgensma' and that we definitely should not waste time because this treatment can only be applied to babies aged between 0 and 2 years. Zolgensma is an adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy. The virus vector contains a healthy and fully functional human SMN gene, and the vector carrying the healthy gene is targeted at the human SMN gene. Application of a single-dose Zolgensma from a vein results with the production of SMN protein in the child's motor neurons; this improves muscle movement and function and ensures a child with SMA to survive. However, $2.1 million USD is required for this gene treatment and the treatment is only applied in the USA.Our Gökalp is currently 18 months old, unable to crawl, stand, or walk. Unfortunately, even though we provide him with physical therapy every day, he cannot even perform the physical movements he had done previously because the disease has continued to get worse. For Gökalp, time is reversing now and all the time we lose unfortunately results in him losing motor neurons a little more.We wish to realize what we dream with our child like every parent, and see the days when he can run, play with his friends and stand on his own in the future. We need your support in this challenging process to make these dreams come true. Our only wish is to see the days our Gökalp can walk and run with your great support …https://www.instagram.com/gokalp_sma/https://www.facebook.com/gokalpsma/https://twitter.com/kucuk_gokalp---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gökalp’in geleceği için umut ol ! Bu bağış kampanyasını arkadaşlarım Sefa ve Yelda Küçük ailesinin tek çocuğu Gökalp Küçük adına başlatıyorum. Gökalp, Spinal Müsküler Atrofi (SMA) Tip 2 hastası. Gökalp’in adım atıp yürüyebilmesi için, Amerika’da sadece 2 yaş altı bebekler için onaylanan ve 2,1 milyon USD bedelindeki Zolgensma isimli gen terapisini alması gerekiyor. Bu ilaç tedavisi Amerika’da uygulanmakta ve hastane masrafları ile birlikte yaklaşık toplam maliyeti 2,4 Milyon USD tutmaktadır. Gökalp şu anda 1,5 yaşında ve zamana karsı yarışıyor. Tüm destek ve yardımlarınız için teşekkür ederiz. Aşağıda ‘’Küçük’’ ailesinin hikâyesini paylaşıyorum. Her anne babanın istediği gibi, bizim de çocuğumuz olacağını öğrendikten sonra tek hayalimiz bir an önce ona kavuşmaktı. Ve o büyük gün bizim için gelmişti, biz heyecan içinde ona kavuşmayı beklerken hayat minik Gökalp’imizin karşısına ilk mücadelesine çıkarıyordu. Bizler daha onun o minik ellerine dokunamadan, kokusunu doya doya içimize çekemeden yoğun bakım kuvözünde hayat mücadelesi vermesi gerekiyordu fakat evladımızın bunun üstesinde geleceğini biliyorduk çünkü o bizim evladımızdı, o daha çok şeyi başaracaktı, beraber yürüyeceğimiz çok yol vardı. Şükürler olsun ki, dualarımız karşılık buldu ve bir hafta sonra Gökalp’imiz o küçük bedeni ama kocaman yüreğiyle hayata karşı ilk zaferini kazandı. Ve o an gelmişti, o artık kollarımızdaydı… Ve bundan sonrası, onu beklerken onunla kurduğumuz hayalleri gerçekleştirme zamanıydı…Gökalp’imiz 3 aylık olduğunda içgüdüsel olarak bazı şeylerin ters gittiğini hissetmeye başladık ve bundan sonra doktorlarla olan serüvenimiz başladı. Çok doktor gezdik, endişe dolu çok uykusuz geceler geçirdik ama bir yandan da bunların geçeceğini, evladımızın her neyi varsa üstesinden beraber geleceğimize inanıyorduk. Fakat, henüz 11 aylıkken hayat bizi Spinal Muskuler Atrofi(SMA) ile tanıştırdı.SMA hastalığı, omurilikte bulunan ön boynuz motor sinir hücrelerini etkileyerek hareket kabiliyetini kısıtlayan genetik bir kas hastalığı. Ön boynuz hücrelerinde bulunan SMN geni hastalık sebebiyle bozuk olduğundan dolayı motor sinir hücrelerinin ihtiyacı olan proteini üretemez ve motor nöronlar ölmeye başlar. Bunun sonucu olarak ise maalesef vücut istemli kaslarını hareket ettiremez hale gelir ve kaslar erimeye başlar.Gökalp artık bu hastalık yüzünden hiçbir zaman koşamayacak, yürüyemeyecek hatta yemek bile yiyemeyecekti. Bunun bir anne babaya neler hissettirdiğini düşünmek bile isteyemezsiniz. Peki ya Gökalp’imiz, onun ne günahı vardı ki hayat onu böyle bir hastalığın pençesine düşürmüştü? O daha küçücük bir bebekti ve en önemlisi masumdu… Bu hastalığı kabullenmemiz cidden çok zordu, kafamızda kendimize binlerce kez sorduğumuz tek bir soru vardı: Neden …Doktorlarımız bu hastalığın ‘Zolgensma’ adında bir gen tedavisi olduğunu ve kesinliklezamankaybetmememizgerektiğini söylediler; çünkü, bu tedavi sadece 0-2 yaş arasındaki bebeklere uygulanabiliyormuş. Zolgensma, adeno ilişkili virüs vektörü tabanlı bir gen tedavisidir. Virüs vektörü, sağlıklı ve tam anlamıyla fonksiyonel insan SMN geni içermekte olup sağlıklı geni taşıyan vektör SMN genini hedef almaktadır. Zolgensma'nın tek doz toplardamardan uygulanması, çocuğun motor nöronlarında SMN proteininin üretilmesi ile sonuçlanır; bu, kas hareketini ve fonksiyonunu geliştirir ve SMA'lı bir çocuğun hayatta kalmasını sağlar. Fakat, sadece Amerika’da uygulanmakta olan bu gen tedavisi için tedavi bedeli olarak 2.1 milyon USD gerekiyor.Gökalp’imiz şu anda 18 aylık, emekleyemiyor, ayakları üstüne basamıyor ve yürüyemiyor. Her gün ona kendi imkânlarımızla fizik tedavi sağlasak da maalesef hastalığı sebebiyle daha kötüye giderek daha küçükken gerçekleştirdiği fiziksel hareketleribile gerçekleştiremiyor. Gökalp için artık zaman tersine akıyor ve kaybettiğimiz herzamanmaalesef onun için motor nöronlarınıbiraz daha kaybetmesi ile sonuçlanıyor.Bizler her anne baba gibi çocuğumuzla hayal ettiklerimizi gerçekleştirmeyi, onun koşup arkadaşlarıyla oynadığı ve kendi başına ayakta durabildiği günleri görmeyi hayal ediyoruz. Bu hayallerimizin gerçekleşebilmesi için bu zorlu süreçte sizlerin desteğine çok ihtiyacımız var. Tek dileğimiz, sizlerin desteğiyle Gökalp’imizin bu tedaviyi alarak yürüyüp koştuğu günleri görebilmek …https://www.instagram.com/gokalp_sma/https://www.facebook.com/gokalpsma/https://twitter.com/kucuk_gokalp---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Werde die Hoffnung für die Zukunft von Gökalp!Ich initiiere diese Spendenkampagne im Namen von Gökalp Küçük, dem einzigen Kind meiner Freunde Sefa und Yelda Küçük. Gökalp ist ein SMA (Spinale Muskelatrophie) Typ 2 Patient. Damit Gökalp Schritte machen und gehen kann, muss er die Gentherapie namens ‘’Zolgensma’’ einnehmen, die für Säuglinge unter 2 Jahren geeignet ist und 2,1 Millionen USD kostet. Diese medikamentöse Behandlung wird nur in den USA angewendet und kostet mit den Krankenhauskosten insgesamt 2,4 Mio. USD. Gökalp ist jetzt 1,5 Jahre alt und konkurriert mit der Zeit. Vielen Dank für all Ihre Schritte. Wie unten beschrieben, möchte ich Ihnen die Geschichte der Familie ‘’Küçük’’ vorstellen. Der wichtigste Moment unseres Lebens begann mit dem Traum, unser Kind kennenzulernen. Nach Gökalps Geburt hatten wir den ersten Schlag unseres Lebens erfahren. Er wurde nach seiner Geburt eine Woche lang auf die Neugeborenen-Intensivstation gebracht. Also verließ er uns, bevor wir Ihn überhaupt umarmen oder seine Hände berühren konnten. Nachdem wir Gökalp bekamen, setzten wir unsere Träume dort fort, wo wir aufgehört hatten. Als er 3 Monate alt war, dachten wir instinktiv, dass etwas nicht richtig läuft. Wir besuchten viele Ärzte, arbeiteten hart und lernten im seinem Alter von 11 Monaten, die sogenannte ‘’Spinale Muskelatrophie (SMA)’’ kennen. Wir wollten es einfach nicht glauben, so dass Nächte zu Tagen und Tage zu Nächten wurden in unserem Leben. Man sagt immer, dass Mütter alles fühlen, aber wir trösteten uns immer wieder mit dem Glauben, dass nicht schwerwiegendes sei. SMA ist eine fortschreitende neuromuskuläre Erkrankung, die schwere Muskelschwäche verursacht und die Fähigkeit der Menschen zum Gehen, Essen und Atmen beeinträchtigt. Sie ist der genetisch bedingte Todesfall Nr. 1 bei Säuglingen. Gökalp ist derzeit 18 Monate alt und kann weder krabbeln, stehen noch gehen. Er kann sich im Liegen nicht alleine aufrichtigen und braucht dringend diese Gentherapie. Wir träumen davon, die Tage zu sehen, an denen Gökalp alleine Stehen und Laufen kann. In diesem herausfordernden Prozess bitten wir Sie Gökalp zu unterstützen und sein Leben zu berühren. Ihre Schritte zu Gökalp werden unsere Hoffnung sein! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Puedes dar un paso a Gökalp?Comienzo esta donación para el único hijo , Gökalp Küçük, de mis amigos, la familia Sefa y Yelda Küçük. Gökalp tiene Atrofia Muscular Espinal (AME) tipo 2. Para que Gökalp camina paso a paso, tiene que recibir la terapia génica, Zolgensa, solamente aprobada en Estados Unidos para los bebes menores de 2 años y vale 2.1 millones de dólares. Este tratamiento se recibe solamente en Estados Unidos y con los gastos de la hospitalización vale 2,4 millones de dólares. Gökalp tiene 1,5 años y está compitiendo con el tiempo. Gracias por todos sus pasos. Más abajo, puedes encontrar la historia de la familia Küçük;El momento más importante de nuestra vida fue el sueño de tener un hijo. Después del nacimiento de Gökalp, recibimos el primer hachazo de nuestra vida. Durante 1 semana, Gökalp estaba en la incubadora, sin saber su olor y sin tocar a sus manos, tuvimos que esperar. Pero ya sabíamos que íbamos a seguir con nuestro sueño de estar con él. Cuando Gökalp cumplió los 3 meses, instintivamente, pensamos que algo no estaba bien. Fuimos a ver muchos médicos, y cuando cumplió los 11 meses, conocimos a Atrofia Muscular Espinal (AME) .Primero, no quisimos creer y los mañanas volvieron a ser noches si las noches fueron las mananas. Dicen que los madres sienten todo, pero nosotros siempre consolamos que nada estaba mal. SMA es una enfermedad neuromuscular progresivo que causa una debilidad muscular grave y afecta la habilidad de comer, respirar y caminar de los gentes. SMA es la causa primera en los muertos genéticos de los bebes. Ahora Gökalp tiene 18 meses, no puede gatear y no puede pisar. Cuando esta durmiendo, no puede levantarse solo y necesita la terapia genica. Nosotros sonamos con la posibilidad de verlo estando en pie y dando pasos. En este proceso difícil, necesitamos que den soporte a Gökalp y que nos ayuden cumpliendo nuestro sueno. Gökalp sera nuestro pasos y la esperanza!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Soyez l' espoir pour l' avenir de Gökalp !Je commerce cette campagne de la donation au nom des mes amis Sefa et Yelda Küçük pour leurs seul enfant Gökalp.Gökalp a la maladie atrophy musculaire en spirale (SMA) Tipe 2.Pour qu'il puisse marcher, il doit prendre la thérapie génique approuvé en Amérique seulement pour les bébés moins de 2 ans et qui coute 2,1 millions USD.Il doit prendre la thérapie Zolgensma. Ce medicament utilisé en Amérique avec les frais de l' hôpital coute 2,4 millions USD. Gökalp a en ce moment 18 mois et on est en concurrence avec le temps. Merci pour toutes vos démarches. Je partage ci dessous l' histoire de la famille Küçük Le moment le plus important de notre vie a commencé avec le rêve de l' arrivé de notre enfant dans notre vie. Avec son venu, nous avons eu le premier coup dur dans la vie.Il a été emmené au cône de soin intensifs pendant 1 semaine et nous a quittés avant de puisse le sentir et lui tenir la main.Quand il a eu 3 mois, nous pensions que certaines choses n' allaient pas bien.Nous avons visité de nombreux médecins , nous avons fait beaucoup d' efforts et quand il a eu 11 mois nous avons fait connaissance avec SMA.Nous ne voulions pas y croire. Nuits comme les jours, jours comme les nuits dans notre vie. Tu sais que les mamans ressentent tout, mais on se récoforté toujours qu'il n y a rien. SMA est une maladie neuromusculaire progressive qui provoque une faiblesse musculaire grave qui affecte la capacité des gens a marcher, manger et respirer et # 1 cause génétique des décès chez les naurrissons. Gökalp a actuelement 18 mois, il ne peux pas ni rester debout ni marcher. Nous voulons voir Gokalp qu' il marche. Dans ce moment difficile, nous avons besoin de vous pour soutenir Gökalp, toucher sa vie, y entrer. Vos pas vers Gökalp seront notre espoir.	data/images/47001500_1586119393583256_r.jpeg

I am starting a campaign for Nil Güleç who is the daughter of my close friends Ali and Nihan Güleç. Nil was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2. In order to have a better future, Nil has to receive a genetic therapy called Zolgensma. Zolgensma costs $ 2.1 million, with additional expenses the total amount reaches $ 2.4 million. Zolgensma approval only covers children under 2 years. Nil is 18 months old. We have a fight against the clock. She must receive her treatment in the United States. Below, you can find the story of Nil and her family. Your donations will be greatly appreciated. This campaign is dedicated exclusively to Nil.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------When you find out you're going to be a mom, everything changes. From that moment on, your life will be completely different, and you start worrying about being able to ensure a good life, a good academic education, the best environment and a more comfortable and safe route throughout your life. And you do it with an unconditional love and you are excited to think about the precious and unique moments to enjoy with your baby.You give birth to your baby and the doctor leaves it in your shaking hands. It is the best feeling in the world. The first contact between you makes you a natural teacher to handle everything that scared you before for lack of experience. You start feeling more secure. And the more you share something with your baby, the more you enjoy being a mother. You already have the answer instinctively of all the questions that you had when you were pregnant. And now is the time to grow together with your baby, cry together, laugh together ...But at one point, even if you have no idea what is happening, something happens and time starts to run in the wrong direction. And that moment all your future plans are shattered, motherhood already has another dimension and your sweet dreams are replaced by a tremendous concern. Because your daughter is diagnosed with a rare disease: Spinal Muscular AtrophyAt first you don't want to believe it. Your heart is broken You blame yourself because you have brought it into the world. Your baby is innocent. On the one hand, you die of regret, your soul hurts, you have the words drowned in your throat but on the other hand the doctors keep telling you that your daughter has to start her treatment immediately. Because every moment, a motor neuron dies.Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease, which is manifested by a progressive loss of muscle strength that affects the ability to walk, swallow and breathe. And it is the first genetic cause of infant mortality. It is caused by a mutation in the survival gene of motor neurons 1 (SMN1). This gene is responsible for the production of a protein that is critical for the nerves that control our muscles. Without this protein, these neurons cannot function properly and die at any given time.Our daughter Nil is 18 months old. And there is a genetic therapy called ""Zolgensma"" approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children under 2 years old with a price of 2.15 million dollars. Zolgensma is designed to replace the missing or defective SMN1 gene with a functional copy that produces the SMN protein, thereby improving the function and survival of motor neurons. It seems that Zolgensma can save lives of those who are lucky enough to get it with a single dose treatment.Today Nil can't stand or walk. Unfortunately, we don't have a second to lose. We imagine her walking, running, playing with her friends and we want her to be part of society, feel proud of herself and have a long life.We, as her parents, without knowing that we are carriers of this disease, are broken, it is hard for us to breathe, say something or think ... We need the support of volunteers who can help us during this fight and donate motor neurons for our little daughter. We hope that Nil is one of the lucky patients receiving this treatment.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------İki çok yakın arkadaşım Ali ve Nihan Güleç’in kızı Nil Güleç için bir bağış kampanyası başlatıyorum. Nil, Spinal Müsküler Atrofi (SMA) Tip 2 hastası. Ona daha sağlıklı bir gelecek bırakabilmek için Amerika’da sadece 2 yaş altındaki bebekler için onaylanan ve 2.1 milyon USD bedelindeki Zolgensma isimli gen terapisini alması gerekiyor. Tedaviyi Amerika’da alacak. Tedavinin diğer maliyetleri ile birlikte toplanması gereken bağış miktarı 2.4 milyon USD’yi buluyor. Nil şuan 18 aylık ve malesef zamanımız çok kısıtlı. Yapacağınız tüm bağışlar bizim için çok değerli. Aşağıda ailesinin hikayesini paylaşıyorum. Bu kampanya sadece Nil’e adanmıştır.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anne olacağınızı öğrendiğinizde tüm dünyanız değişir. O saniyeden sonra artık hayat bambaşkadır. Dünyaya yeni bir can getirmenin sorumluluğuyla, bebeğiniz için en iyi hayatı, en doğru eğitim koşullarını, en kaliteli sosyal ortamı ve de en sağlıklı hayatı sunmak için planlar yaparsınız. Bunu koşulsuz bir aşkla yaparken bir yandan da zaman su gibi akıp gitmesin, her anın tadına doyasıya varmak istersiniz.Doğum günü gelir kapıyı çalar. Doktorunuz deneyimsiz ellerinize minik bebeğinizi verir. İşte bu dünyanın en güzel en tarif edilemez hissidir. Bebeğinizle kurduğunuz bağ sizi hiç deneyimlemediğiniz bir konuda uzman yapar. Kendinize güvenmeye başlarsınız. Ve paylaştıkça ebeveyn olmanın keyfini çıkarırsınız. Doğum öncesinde aklınıza gelen tüm soru işaretleri artık cevabını hayatın bu doğal akışında cevap bulmaya başlar. Ve zaman bebeğinizle büyümenin, onunla ağlamanın ve gülmenin zamanıdır.Ancak bir noktada siz farkında olmasanız dahi, bazen zaman tam tersine akar. Ve o andan itibaren bildiğiniz tek şey, gelecek planlarınızın çöktüğü, o güne kadarki ebeveynlik serüveninizin kökten değiştiği bir boyuta geçtiği ve kurduğunuz tatlı hayallerin kaygıya dönüştüğüdür. Çünkü gözünüzden sakındığınız bebeğinize ismini hiç duymadığınız nadir bir hastalık tanısı konmuştur. Spinal Müskuler Atrofi. Önce inanmak istemezsiniz. Kalbiniz paramparça olur. Kendinizi suçlarsınız, çünkü dünyaya gelmek isteyen kişi bebeğiniz değildir. Bebeğiniz masumdur. Kalbiniz daimi bir pişmanlık yaşarken, doktorların devamlı söylediği cümle aklınızdan asla çıkmaz: “Bir an evvel tedaviye başlamalı!”. Çünkü her kaybettiğiniz saniye bebeğinizde bir motor nöron ölmektedir.SMA, insanların yürüme, yemek ve nefes alma yeteneğini etkileyen şiddetli kas güçsüzlüğüne neden olan ilerleyici bir nöromüsküler hastalıktır. Ve bebeklerde 1 numaralı genetik ölüm nedenidir. Bu, sağkalım motor nöron gen 1'deki (SMN) bir mutasyondan kaynaklanır. Sağlıklı bir insanda bu gen, kaslarımızı kontrol eden sinirlerin işlevi için kritik olan bir protein üretir. SMN geni SMA’da bozuk olup hiç protein üretemediği için vücutta motor nöron kayıpları olur. Bunun sonucunda ise istemli kaslar iyi hareket edemez kuvvetsizlik ve kas zayıflığı (atrofi) görülür.Nil şuan 18 aylık. FDA tarafından sadece 0-2 yaş bebekler için onaylanmış “Zolgensma” adlı bir gen terapisi mevcut bulunmaktadır. Ancak malesef ilacın bedeli 2.15 milyon dolar. Zolgensma, adeno ilişkili virüs vektörü tabanlı bir gen tedavisidir. Virüs vektörü, sağlıklı ve tam anlamıyla fonksiyonel insan SMN geni içermektedir. Sağlıklı geni taşıyan vektör SMN genini hedef almaktadır. Zolgensma'nın tek doz intravenoz (toplardamardan) uygulaması, çocuğun motor nöronlarında SMN proteininin üretilmesi ile sonuçlanır; bu, kas hareketini ve fonksiyonunu geliştirir ve SMA'lı bir çocuğun hayatta kalmasını sağlar.Tek seferlik tedavi ile yeterince şanslı olan hastaların hayatlarını kurtarabilir.Nil kendi gücüyle ayağa kalkamıyor, yürüyemiyor. Ve bu gen tedavisi için üzerimizde ciddi bir zaman baskısı var. Nil’in ayaklandığı, arkadaşlarıyla birlikte koştuğu, ait olduğu toplumda özgüvenli biri olması, uzun ve sağlıklı bir yaşam sürmesi için her gün her gece dua ediyoruz.Anne baba olarak, bilmeden ve istemeden bu hastalığın taşıyıcısı olmanın getirdiği sorumluluğun altında her geçen gün kahroluyoruz, nefes alamıyoruz. Bu zorlu yolculuğumuzda bizimle birlikte yürüyecek ve Nil için motor nöron bağışlamak isteyen gönüllülere ihtiyacımız var. Umuyoruz ki sizlerin de desteğiyle Nil, bu gen terapiyi alacak şanslı bebeklerden biri olacak.Eğer siz de Nil’in hayatını kurtarmak için bizlere yardımcı olmak isterseniz, bize destek verebilirsiniz.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Estoy comenzando una campaña para Nil Güleç que es la hija de mis íntimos amigos Ali y Nihan Güleç, a quien le diagnosticaron con atrofía muscular espinal (AME) tipo 2. Para poder tener un futuro, Nil tiene que recibir una terapia genética llamada Zolgensma.

Tus donaciones serán enormemente apreciadas. Esta campaña está dedicada exclusivamente a Nil.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cuando te enteras de que vas a ser mamá, todo cambia. A partir de ese momento tu vida será distinta completamente, ya empiezas a preocuparte por poder asegurarle una buena vida, una buena educación académica, el mejor entorno y un recorrido más cómodo y seguro a lo largo de su vida. Y lo haces con un amor incondicional y te ilusiona pensar en los momentos preciosos e únicos para disfrutar con tu bebé. Das a luz a tu bebé y el médico lo deja en tus manos temblorosas. Es el mejor sentimiento del mundo. El primer contacto entre vosotros te convierte en una maestra natural para manejar todo que te asustaba antes por falta de experiencia. Empiezas a sentirte más segura. Y cuanto más compartes algo con tu bebé, más disfrutas de ser madre. Ya tienes la respuesta instintivamente de todas las preguntas que te comían la cabeza cuando estabas embarazada. Y ahora es el momento de crecer junto con tu bebé, llorar juntos, reír juntos... Pero en un momento dado, aunque no tengas ni idea de lo que está pasando, pasa algo y el tiempo empieza a correr a una dirección equivocada. Y ese momento todos tus planes futuros están destrozados, la maternidad ya tiene otra dimensión y tus sueños dulces están sustituidos por una preocupación tremenda. Porque le diagnostican a tu hija con una enfermedad rara: La Atrofía Muscular Espinal Al principio no quieres creértelo. Se te rompe el corazón. Te culpas a ti misma porque tú lo has traído al mundo. Tu bebé es inocente. Por un lado, te mueres de arrepentimiento, te duele el alma, se te quedan las palabras ahogadas en la garganta pero por otro lado los médicos siguen diciéndote que tu hija tiene que comenzar su tratamiento inmediatamente. Porque cada momento, muere una neurona motora. La Atrofía Muscular Espinal (SMA por su sigla en inglés) es una enfermedad neuromuscular, que se manifiesta por una pérdida progresiva de la fuerza muscular que afecta la capacidad de caminar, tragar y respirar. Y es la primera causa genética de mortalidad infantil. Es causada por una mutación en el gen de supervivencia de las neuronas motoras 1 (SMN1). Este gen es responsable de la producción de una proteína que es crítica para los nervios que controlan nuestros músculos. Sin dicha proteína, estas neuronas no pueden funcionar correctamente y mueren en un momento dado. Nuestra hija Nil tiene 18 meses. Y existe una terapia genética llamada “Zolgensma” aprobada por la Administración de Medicamentos y Alimentos de EE. UU. (FDA por sus siglas en inglés) para los niños menores de 2 años con un precio de 2.15 millones de dólares. Zolgensma está diseñada para reemplazar el gen SMN1 faltante o defectuoso con una copia funcional que produce la proteína SMN, mejorando así la función y la supervivencia de las neuronas motoras. Parece que Zolgensma puede salvar vidas de aquellos que tienen la suerte de obtenerlo con un tratamiento de única dosis. Hoy Nil no puede ponerse de pie o caminar. Desgraciadamente no tenemos ni un segundo a perder. Este tratamiento es nuestra única oportunidad para su futuro. Me la imagino caminando, corriendo, jugando con sus amigos y quiero que forme parte de la sociedad, se sienta orgullosa de sí misma y tenga una vida larga. Nosotros, como sus padres, sin saber que somos portadores de esta enfermedad, estamos destrozados, ya nos cuesta respirar, decir algo o pensar… Necesitamos el apoyo de voluntarios que puedan echarnos una mano durante esta lucha y donar neuronas motoras para nuestra pequeña hija. Esperamos que Nil sea uno de los pacientes afortunados que recibe este tratamiento."	data/images/46072754_1583838455417877_r.jpeg

That each day you must appreciate a basic skill before it has been taken from you. Life expectancy is 2-5 years and paralysis comes much sooner.Why does it happen?We are still at the infancy of understanding this disease and there has not been any definitive cause. Can some point to the game of football with claims of cause, sure. But reality is, all you will be doing is grasping for an answer.An answer that will never come.I know my brother, I know he is a fighter and know he will bite his lip and fight!As he sits up in the doctors chair, he asked “How do I fight it?”That is where the nightmare takes hold. Because there is even less answers to this question than the one of cause.As an athlete you want a game plan, as a firemen you want a protocol, as a human you want hope! But right now all I can do is look at him and pray.Pray that he will be spared.Pray that he will enjoy each dayPray that he will know I will love him through all this.Today, I have no answer to WHY it happens or WHAT to do, but I do have an answer for HOW you and I can help!According to HuffPost.com, “ALS is a very expensive disease, costing patients an estimated $300,000 a year. The majority of patients bankrupt their families with the costs, and an even larger number simply can’t afford the cost to stay alive, so they don’t. Can you imagine - having to stop BEING ALIVE because it’s too expensive?”All proceeds will go towards Eric’s treatment and care and will help raise awareness of ALS.We are so grateful for everyone’s continued support.The Stevens FamilyLearn more about Eric and his Battle to #axeALS at his Facebook page, Team Stevens Nation.https://www.facebook.com/groups/teamstevensnation/	data/images/42600232_1570640521184863_r.jpeg

SMA is a nightmare, it is a disease that robs people of physical strength by affecting the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, taking away the ability to walk, eat or breathe. SMA Type I specifically is the most severe, diagnosed prior to one year of age. Eva is among the youngest known cases, diagnosed at just 7 weeks old.Our baby girl Eva is an expressive, smiley, and happy baby who is loved so much by her family and friends. She came into all our lives and brought a shining light with her that follows her everywhere she goes. At 2 months of age, her life has already made ours so much more full and meaningful and we could not imagine a life without her. Some of her top favourite things are: music, having her diaper changed, and of course conversations with Mommy and Daddy. As Eva’s parents, we want her to live a long, happy and healthy life and we are ready to do whatever it takes to ensure she receives the best medical care available.As we live in Canada, we do have a treatment called Spinraza available to us which increases survival motor neuron (SMN) protein production, addressing an underlying cause of SMA. We are beyond grateful that we have this available as just a few years ago, babies with SMA did not have this hope and would likely not live to reach the age of 2.There is, however, a treatment available which goes by the name Zolgensma. It is made up of a new, working copy of a human SMN gene that is placed inside a vector. A vector’s job is to take the new, working SMN gene to the motor neuron cells in the body. When the new gene reaches its destination, it is ready to tell the motor neuron cells to start making SMN protein. Although these are all positive outcomes and would allow our beautiful baby Eva to no longer have the difficult symptoms of SMA making her life easier without difficulty walking, eating or breathing the upsetting downside of it all is that it is FDA approved only in The United States and not in Canada. This treatment has a large price tag of $2.1 million dollars! USD! That’s right, talk about putting a price tag on your child’s life. It is a devastating amount that any middle class family can never achieve. We are begging our community, family, friends and everyone willing to help donate or simply share our page as every effort and donation makes a difference and will get our daughter Eva that much closer to this life-saving medication we so desperately need. I want to already express my appreciation to everyone who is willing to help our family, we could never gather the proper words to explain the depth of heartache and sadness we are facing. This is something no child or human should ever have to experience. To help get the word out, please share this Go Fund Me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and get your friends and family to do the same! Myself and my family will forever be grateful for it. 	data/images/42600164_1570639439705078_r.jpeg

Little Livie has been diagnosed with a rare and serious genetic neuromuscular condition called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1. SMA is caused by a gene deletion which results in deterioration of Livie’s nerve cells connecting her brain and spinal cord to her body’s muscles. There is no cure and Livie has its most severe type. Livie’s muscles used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up, moving her head, and even swallowing and breathing, are becoming progressively weaker and shrinking. Without any treatment, little Livie’s condition would continue to deteriorate and it would be unlikely that she would live past her 2nd birthday. Every child with SMA is different and little Livie’s future is very uncertain. Treatment options for little Livie are very limited. Our best hope for a better life for Livie is a once-off gene therapy called Zolgensma, which is currently only available in USA. It costs approximately US$2,100,000. Studies have shown that Zolgensma can substantially improve quality of life. Livie's antibody test qualifies her for the treatment. We are against the clock as Zolgensma is only available to children under the age of two years. Little Livie’s StoryLittle Livie was born on the 26th August 2019. We have never felt a love like this. It was incredible for us to see our first child smile, laugh and babble for the first time and watch her develop her little bright, affectionate and loving personality. Livie brings such joy and happiness to our lives every day and her smile can brighten the whole room even on the rainiest Irish day.We grew concerned as Livie missed some of her development milestones. We contacted her GP and were eventually referred to Crumlin Children’s Hospital. Our world changed forever on 9th April when little Livie was diagnosed with SMA type 1. This condition affects approximately one in every 10,000 babies. It had already been such a hard time for our family with the COVID-19 lockdown. Due to hospital policy on social distancing, Karen (Livie’s mum) was alone when given the diagnosis and Keith (Livie’s dad) was alone when he heard the diagnosis over the phone. It is something that will stay with us and our family for the rest of our lives. We were left devastated and one of the hardest parts of this process is being isolated without support from our family and friends during this difficult time.SMA does not affect Livie’s cognitive ability. She remains a bright, alert and bubbly little girl, curious about everything she sees and desperate to experience life. Livie’s smile and laugh are infectious. She loves engaging with people and wants to be in the thick of every conversation around her. Normal infections and illnesses such as a chest infection can be very serious for Livie, possibly life-threatening. The current COVID-19 pandemic is so worryingly dangerous for Livie. Karen will be Livie’s full time carer as Livie needs support all day and every day. Her days and weeks are busy with medical appointments and check-ups.Livie has received her first dose of another treatment called Spinraza through a lumbar puncture in Ireland. We remain hopeful that Spinraza will prolong Livie’s life and allow Livie to gain a degree of head control and sit with extra support. We have been advised that Livie will still need respiratory and feeding intervention to survive. She is already struggling with her breathing and coughing. She needs to wear an oxygen mask every night. This is very uncomfortable for Livie and she struggles to sleep with it. It is very unlikely that Livie will ever stand or walk.We are fundraising for Zolgensma because we could never afford to pay for this treatment by ourselves. Our dream for Livie is to give her the best chance at life possible. Zolgensma is our best hope to do this. If we are unable to raise enough funds to pay for little Livie’s treatment, we will put all donations towards Livie’s care with the hope of giving her the most comfortable and happy life possible.	data/images/47916028_1588856923726087_r.jpeg

Sinai hospital after successfully coming off a ventilator 7 days prior. Her premature daughter was delivered at 30 weeks and is in the NICU. The arrest lasted 8 minutes and has left her with anoxic brain injury due to lack of oxygen and presently she’s awake but minimally conscious, not able to respond to sounds, touch or commands.Sylvia will need significant long-term acute cognitive and physical therapy to help give her a fighting chance for her baby Esther and her 3 year old toddler Jay. Sylvia’s union insurance unfortunately covers only 30 days of acute rehabilitation - at centers like Kessler in NJ, Moss Rehab in PA and TIRR Memorial in Texas - a handful across the country that specialize in recovery for people suffering from severe disorders of consciousness due to lack of oxygen to the brain like Sylvia.Sylvia’s family has been fighting early on to get her the best care possible, from transferring her to Mt. Sinai hospital and getting her into an acute rehabilitation center. Please help Sylvia get the care she needs to be there for her family.About Sylvia:Sylvia is 35, a nurse at Brookdale Hospital, wife and mother of 2 young children. Sylvia is truly loved by her friends & family for her warmth, dedication to people who are underserved and love for God. Sylvia sadly contracted COVID19 while working to help other sick patients and now she and her children need your support. Your generous donation will go to Sylvia’s medical expenses and care for her children. We thank you and cherish your gift of love.	data/images/47621374_1588124411281898_r.jpeg

Nous étions aux anges. Malheureusement, cela n’a pas duré très longtemps.Notre petit bébé a été diagnostiqué atteint par l’Amyotrophie Spinale de Type 1 le 12 décembre 2019 à seulement 8 semaines de vie. Cette maladie génétique dégénérative est tout simplement inhumaine. Elle s’attaque aux moto-neurones et atrophie tous les muscles du corps et se termine par une détresse respiratoire ou un problème de déglutition qui conduit au décès.Le Type 1 est la forme la plus grave de toute. La grande majorité des bébés décèdent avant d’atteindre l’âge de 2 ans en l’absence de traitement.Le traitement que Nathan reçoit présentement, qui peut non pas guérir mais ralentir la progression de la maladie ne garantit aucunement que Nathan arrivera un jour à se tenir debout ou voir même se tenir la tête tout simplement. Nathan a reçu ses 4 injections par ponction lombaire et désormais il devra en recevoir trois fois par année à vie. Par miracle, Nathan est toujours vivant et il recommence même à bouger un peu. C’est un vrai battant, il garde le sourire malgré tout.Hors, un nouveau traitement révolutionnaire appelé ZOLGENSMA est arrivé sur le marché. Il est approuvé dans plusieurs autres pays (États-Unis, Japon, France…) mais pas encore au Canada. Il est injecté en UNE SEULE DOSE UNIQUE donc beaucoup moins invasif que le traitement actuel. Plusieurs enfants traités dans le monde entier accomplissent des choses impensables dans les circonstances comme se tenir debout ou marcher. Le seul HIC: ce médicament est le plus cher au monde. Il coûte 2.8 MILLIONS DE DOLLARDS CANADIENS. Aussi, il doit être administré avant l’âge de deux ans pour être bénéfique. Ce qui rend le tout IMPOSSIBLE à atteindre.SVP aidez-nous à donner à Nathan la meilleure qualité de vie possible. Sa vie à débuter dans beaucoup de souffrance mais nous avons tout fait pour qu’il soit le plus heureux malgré tout et nous voulons lui offrir la chance d’avoir tout ce qui peut faire en sorte qu’il puisse marcher, voir même sauter et pourquoi pas courir. Bref, aidez-nous à RÉALISER L’IMPOSSIBLE.SVP pour nous aider davantage, partagez ce GofundME sur FACEBOOK et INSTAGRAM en demandant à votre famille et vos amis de participer à réaliser l’impossible.Merci infiniment.Hello,This is a fundraiser for our baby boy Nathan Ouellet, born on October 20th, 2019.The births of Nathan and his twin brother filled our hearts with joy and happiness. For a brief moment we felt truly blessed. This unfortunately didn’t last very long.Our little boy was diagnosed with type 1 Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) on December 12th, 2019, aged only 8 weeks.This genetic and degenerative disease is simply inhumane. It attacks motor neurons and causes generalized muscle wasting, eventually leading to respiratory failure and extreme deglutition problems which cause death.Type 1 SMA is the most severe. Without treatment, life expectancy for a child with the disease is under 2 years.The treatment Nathan currently receives helps slow the progression of the disease but cannot cure it. Even with this treatment, there is no guarantee Nathan will ever be able to hold his head without the help of a device, even less walk on his two feet. Our baby boy has received 4 injections by lumbar puncture thus far, and is set to receive three a year for the rest of his life. Nathan is still alive by some miracle and has even started moving a little. He truly is a fighter, and he keeps smiling through it all.There exists a revolutionary gene therapy treatment called ZOLGENSMA. It has been approved in several countries so far (United States, Japan, France …), but not yet in Canada where we live. It is delivered in a UNIQUE, ONE-TIME INJECTION, and is therefore much less invasive than the treatment Nathan currently receives. Several children who have received it have shown dramatic signs of improvement in their condition, with many being able to stand up or even walk. The problem: it is one of the most expensive medications in the world.Each shot costs 2.8 MILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS.More importantly, it needs to be administered before the age of two in order to be effective.With such a high cost and time against us, it is virtually IMPOSSIBLE for our baby boy to receive this treatment.We kindly ask that you help us give Nathan the quality of life he deserves. In the short time he has been alive, he has endured more suffering than most of us will during our entire lifetimes. As his parents we want to give every opportunity to be a happy, healthy boy who can walk, jump and even run.Please help us make it POSSIBLE by donating.Help us share Nathan’s story by sharing this GoFundMe page on FACEBOOK and INSTAGRAM to your friends and family, and be part of achieving the impossible.A million thank yous.	data/images/48410672_1590849013636432_r.jpeg

He was visiting town from Los Angeles for one night for a wedding, but the course of his life was changed forever.Despite the presence of up to 300 people in the street, Pedro was the only person hit in the gunfire, and his injuries are severe. The bullet entered his body at the back of his neck and ended up in his C4 vertebra, shattering parts of his spine and severing his spinal cord, initially leaving him paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe on his own. It is a miracle that he is alive, and the progress he has already made towards recovery – including regaining partial control of his breathing and movement in his shoulders – has defied doctors' expectations.The road to recovery for Pedro will be long, but he is dedicated to continuing his journey and living a full life. As we, his immediate family, are still in the wake of this devastating tragedy, it’s difficult to imagine what the future holds, but we know that Pedro will never cease to be the brilliant, beautiful, hardworking, and vivacious man that he is. We simply need to be able to support him along that journey.We are asking for your help to cover the costs of hospital stays, rehabilitation facilities, and 24/7 care for Pedro as he transitions into a life that is different, but still his own. We also need help with housing, transportation, and food costs for our family as we support him during this time. Your support means the world to Pedro and to all of us.About Pedro:Pedro is a fighter, a light in this world and a joy to all those who know him. He has always been a pioneer, a brave young man who has consistently defied expectations. Pedro is a first-generation immigrant from the Dominican Republic who came to New York City at the age of four and was quickly recognized as among the brightest of his peers. Despite not speaking English when he arrived, he was placed in gifted and talented school programs almost immediately, went on to graduate from the prestigious Prep for Prep leadership development program, and became the first member of his family to go to college. After graduating with honors from Wesleyan University in 2010, he went on to establish a career in the music industry which has taken him from New York to Miami and now Los Angeles. Pedro has a deep passion for his work and has thrived by carving his own path, conducting business in English, Spanish, and Portuguese and booking concert tours and festival appearances around the world for artists of all kinds.An incredibly dedicated friend, family member, worker, and partner, Pedro is always the first person to volunteer to help and always has the biggest smile on his face. His compassion for others is palpable, his creativity knows no bounds, and he is beloved by all those who know him. He is a truly remarkable person, and we know his journey to recovery will be no different. Thank you for keeping him in your thoughts, and for contributing what you can to help him with this next phase of his life.	data/images/42753384_1571256339967449_r.jpeg

On Wednesday, his 26th birthday, he was released from the hospital and was simply just grateful to be alive.The officer that committed this heinous crime has been protected by law enforcement and therefore we are unable to hold them accountable at this moment.Brandon has been permanently maimed and is now disabled.He has a long way to go with medical and life expenses.We acknowledge that times are tough and appreciate anything that you can donate for my son.Thanks you for all of the messages of encouragement as well.TY SINCERELY BRANDON SAENZ AND FAMILY	data/images/48501678_159149888298298_r.jpg

Tommy Rivers and his beautiful family have been a shining light guiding so many through dark times; now is the time to reciprocate and prove that love is, indeed, always the answer. As some of you may know, almost a month ago, Tommy Rivs was admitted to the ICU with respiratory issues. After several weeks of testing and a lung biopsy, doctors discovered the presence of cancer. Specifically, Tommy Rivers was diagnosed with Primary Pulmonary NK T-Cell Lymphoma, a very rare and aggressive form of Lymphoma. Tommy was moved to a hospital in Scottsdale, AZ, where he is receiving chemotherapy under the guidance and expertise of some of the leading lymphoma physicians in the world. As you can imagine, this treatment is expensive, and Tommy and his family could use all of the financial support they can get.Your generosity can help lighten the load, so that he can focus on recovery, as he taught us to do. Your kind donation will go directly to Steph and Tommy to help deal with the financial repercussions of his current condition, so they can focus on healing and supporting one another. Other ways to help: Because love knows no bounds and neither does Tommy’s heart, even from his ICU bed, he urged us to consider donating to provide emergency assistance to families of the Navajo nation, through an organization that is dear to him, Ajooba' Hasin, Families to Families. https://www.gofundme.com/f/clean-water-for-navajo	data/images/49737942_1595047374406574_r.jpeg

I am starting this campaign on behalf of My brother Gürkan Erdoğan and his wife İpek Erdoğan. Their son Rüzgar Erdoğan has been diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 which is the most severe type of SMA. For Rüzgar to live he urgently needs to receive genetic therapy called Zolgensma which will enable him to lead a normal life, the cost is 2.5 million USD (with all the expenses). We have managed to gather 1 million USD from a charitable person, but we are desperate for the remaining 1.5 million USD. The treatment is possible in United States and Israel so all the fund will be transferred to the medicine company. Rüzgar has passed a vital test that shows that he is eligible for Zolgensma, which will mean your kind donations will not be in vain. Please take a moment to read the paragraphs below which were written by his parents.“Please, give my son a chance”.July 17, 2019, was the best day of our lives when our baby boy was born. The first thing in my mind as his father was “why did we wait so long to have him?” as it was love at first sight. His looks, his smell, his touch… Everything about him made me feel like I was in paradise.Before he was born, I was afraid that it was selfish to bring a child into sometimes feels like a cruel world, this was the main reason we had him late on in life, but when I held him in my arms all my fears were gone. Now being a father, like any other parent my only aim is to make him happy.August 16, 2019, Rüzgar was diagnosed SMA TYPE 1. I had no idea what SMA was, unfortunately I had to learn that SMA is a genetical disease in which the lack of SMN1 gene that the body needs to have muscular motion causes the muscle clusters for nutrition and respiratory to not to develop, also leading to death of motor neurons. And it is the first genetic cause of infant mortality.I cannot describe the feeling and I won’t even try to. Nevertheless, you should know one thing, the phrase “Time heals everything” is a big lie. I don’t even know what to tell him if he ever asks me, “Why did this happen to me dad”?As a parent, I had dreams and ambitions for my baby boy and a bucket list to fulfil with him as a family. Regular things that every parent dream of doing with their child, “Teaching them to ride a bike”, “Playing football together”, “Teaching him how to drive”, these things that we dreamt of seem so far out of sight for my child now… As we don’t know if he will survive or not.How will I tell my baby boy, that my recessive genes with %25 chance caused him not to be able to walk, sit straight or even breathe? How will I look at his face, I don’t know.I hope that you can see in your heart to give and share any amount, it will be a step closer to saving my son.”https://www.instagram.com/ruzgaryuruyecek/https://twitter.com/ruzgaryuruyecek/status/1240319001902960643?s=21Facebook: http://bit.ly/3a18FuT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sevgili Yardım severler;Ben Tarkan Erdoğan ve İngiltere’de Yaşıyorum. Bu kampanyayı kardeşim ve eşi Gürkan ve İpek Erdoğan’ın oğlu yeğenim Rüzgar Erdoğan için başlatıyorum. Yeğenim Rüzgar, SMA’nın en kötü türü olan Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) TİP 1 hastası. Rüzgar kardeşimin ilk ve tek çocuğu ve Rüzgar’ın yaşaması veyahut daha iyi bir hayata sahip olması için acilen Zolgensma adında gen terapisine ihtiyacı var. Zolgensma Amerika ve İsrail’de yapılabiliyor ve tüm masraflar dahil tutarı 2,5 milyon dolar.). Bir hayırseverden 1 milyon dolar destek almayı başardık ancak geri kalan 1,5 milyon dolar için yardımlarınıza ihtiyacımız var. Rüzgar’ın Zolgensma alınabilmesi için gerekli olan testi geçti bu anlamda yardımlarınızın hiçbiri heba olmayacak.Aşağıda anne babasının yazdığı yazıyı bulabilirsiniz;Lütfen oğlumuza bir şans verin!17 Temmuz 2019 hayatımızın en güzel günüydü, oğlumuz o gün doğmuştu. Babası olarak, ilk bakışta oğluma aşık oldum ve ilk aklımdan geçen “neden bu kadar bekledik ki?” cümlesi olmuştu. Bakışı kokusu, dokunuşu, oğlumun her şeyi benim için büyüleyici güzellikte idi.Oğlumuz doğmadan önce bu zorlu dünyaya çocuk getirmenin tereddütleri yüzünden, geç yaşta baba oldum ama oğlumu kollarımda tuttuğumda tüm korkularım geride kalmıştı, bir baba olmuştum ve her ebeveyn gibi hayatımda ki tek amaç oğlumu mutlu etmek olacaktı.16 Ağustosta oğluma SMA TİP 1 teşhisi kondu. SMA’nın ne olduğuna dair en ufak bir fikrim yoktu maalesef zor yoldan öğrenmek zorunda kaldım: SMA genetik bir hastalık ve hareket edebilmemiz için gerekli olan SMN1 geninin vücutta var olmaması sebebiyle, beslenme ve solunum kaslarının gelişememesine, sinyal alamayan motor nöronların zamanla ölmesine sebep olduğu için günümüzde çocuk ölümlerinin bir numaralı sebebi. Gelişemeyen kaslar yüzünden hastalar beslenme, solunum, yürüyememe, dik duramama, boynunu tutama gibi sonuçlar ile yüzleşmek zorunda kalıyorlar.Bunun nasıl bir his olduğunu anlatamam, anlatmaya çalışmayacağım bile. Ancak hepinizin bilmenizi isterim ki, “Zaman her şeyin ilacı” sözü büyük bir yalan… Oğlum “baba bu neden benim başıma geldi?” diye sorarsa diye korkuyorum ve ne diyeceğimi bile bilmiyorum. Kelimeler, düşünceler boğazıma düğümleniyor.Her anne baba gibi bizim de hayallerimiz vardı, basit şeyler, oğluma bisiklet sürmeyi öğretecektim, birlikte top oynayacaktık, araba sürmeyi öğretecektim ona. Bunlar şu an çok uzakta görünüyor, şu an yaşayacak mı oğlum ondan bile emin değilim.Umarım, kalbinizde oğlumu kurtarmak için biraz yer açıp bize yardımcı olabilirsiniz.https://www.instagram.com/ruzgaryuruyecek/https://twitter.com/ruzgaryuruyecek/status/1240319001902960643?s=21Facebook: http://bit.ly/3a18FuT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chers Sympathisants,Je m'appelle Tarkan Erdoğan et je viens du Royaume-Uni. Je lance cette campagne au nom de mon frère Gürkan et de son épouse İpek. Leur fils Rüzgar a été diagnostiqué avec une atrophie musculaire spinale (AMS) de type 1 qui est le type le plus sévère de l’AMS. Pour que Rüzgar vive, il a besoin de toute urgence de recevoir une thérapie génétique appelée Zolgensma qui lui permettra de mener une vie normale et qui coûte 2,5 millions de dollars (avec toutes les dépenses - environ 2,34 millions d'euros). Nous avons réussi à recueillir 1 million de dollars grâce à une personne charitable, mais nous sommes désespérés pour les 1,5 million restants (environ 1,4 million d'euros). Le traitement est possible aux États-Unis et en Irael, donc tout le fonds sera transféré à la société de médecine. Rüzgar a passé un test vital qui montre qu'il est éligible pour Zolgensma. Cela signifie que s'il reçoit le traitement il sera guéri, et donc vos dons ne seront pas vains. Veuillez prendre un moment pour lire les paragraphes ci-dessous que ses parents ont rédigés.« S'il vous plaît, donnez une chance à mon fils.Le 17 juillet 2019 a été le plus beau jour de notre vie, lorsque notre petit garçon est né. La première chose qui m'est venue à l'esprit en tant que papa a été ""pourquoi avons-nous attendu si longtemps pour l'avoir"", car c'était le coup de foudre. Son regard, son odeur, son toucher... Tout en lui me donnait l'impression d'être au paradis.Avant sa naissance, j'avais peur que ce soit égoïste d'amener un enfant dans un monde parfois cruel, c'était la principale raison pour laquelle nous l'avons eu tard dans la vie. Mais quand je l'ai tenu dans mes bras, toutes mes craintes ont disparu. Maintenant, en tant que père, comme tout autre parent, mon seul but est de le rendre heureux.Le 16 août 2019, Rüzgar a été diagnostiqué SMA TYPE 1. Je n'avais aucune idée de ce que SMA était malheureusement, j'ai dû apprendre que la SMA est une maladie génétique dans laquelle le manque de gène SMN1 dont le corps a besoin pour avoir un mouvement musculaire empêche la formation des grappes musculaires pour la nutrition et les voies respiratoires, entraînant également la mort des motoneurones. Cette maladie est la première cause génétique de mortalité infantile.Je ne peux pas décrire ce sentiment et je ne vais même pas essayer de le faire. Néanmoins, vous devez savoir une chose, la phrase ""Le temps guérit tout"" est un gros mensonge. Je ne sais même pas quoi lui dire s'il me demande un jour ""Pourquoi est-ce que cela m’est arrivé, Papa?En tant que parent, j'avais des rêves et des ambitions pour mon petit garçon et une liste de choses à faire en famille avec lui. Les choses que tous les parents rêvent de faire régulièrement avec leur enfant, leur apprendre à faire du vélo, jouer au football ensemble, lui apprendre à conduire, ces choses dont nous rêvions semblent si lointaines pour mon enfant maintenant... Comme nous ne savons pas s'il survit bien ou non.Comment vais-je dire à mon petit garçon que mes gènes récessifs ont une chance de 25% de l'empêcher de marcher, de s'asseoir droit et même de respirer? Comment est-ce que je vais regarder son visage? Je ne sais pas.J'espère que vous pourrez ouvrir un petit espace dans votre cœur pour nous aider à sauver mon fils. »https://www.instagram.com/ruzgaryuruyecek/https://twitter.com/ruzgaryuruyecek/status/1240319001902960643?s=21Facebook: http://bit.ly/3a18FuT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Liebe Mitmenschen,Bei meinem Neffen Rüzgar wurde eine spinale Muskelatrophie (SMA) Typ 1 diagnostiziert, welche die schwerste Form der SMA ist.SMA ist eine genetisch bedingte Krankheit, bei der das Fehlen des SMN1-Gens, welches der Körper für die Muskelbewegung benötigt dazu führt, dass sich die für die Ernährung und Atmung erforderlichen Muskelgruppen nicht entwickeln können. Außerdem führt es zum absterben von Motoneuronen. Es ist die häufigste genetische Ursache für Kindersterblichkeit.Rüzgar ist das einzige Kind meines Bruders. Damit Rüzgar überleben kann, muss er dringend eine genetische Therapie namens Zolgensma erhalten, die ihm in Zukunft ein normales Leben ermöglichen könnte. Leider betragen die Kosten 2,5 Mio. USD. Es ist uns bereits gelungen, 1 Mio. USD von einer wohltätigen Person zu sammeln, jedoch benötigen wir immer noch dringend die restlichen 1,5 Mio. USD. Rüzgar hat einen wichtigen Test bestanden, der gezeigt hat, dass er für Zolgensma infrage kommt. Ihre großzügige Spende wäre somit nicht umsonst. Bitte nehmen Sie sich einen Moment Zeit, um die folgenden Absätze zu lesen, die von seinen Eltern verfasst wurden.Bitte, geben Sie meinem Sohn eine Chance. Der 17. Juli 2019 war der beste Tag unseres Lebens, als unser kleiner Junge geboren wurde. Das erste, was mir als sein Vater einfiel war, ""warum haben wir so lange gewartet, um ihn zu bekommen"", denn es war Liebe auf den ersten Blick. Sein Aussehen, sein Geruch, seine Berührung... Alles an ihm gab mir das Gefühl, im Paradies zu sein.Bevor er geboren wurde hatte ich Angst, dass es egoistisch sei, ein Kind in eine Welt zu bringen, die sich manchmal wie eine grausame Welt anfühlt. Das war der Hauptgrund, warum wir ihn erst spät im Leben hatten. Aber als ich ihn in meinen Armen hielt, waren alle meine Ängste verschwunden. Jetzt ist es mein einziges Ziel als Vater, wie jedes andere Elternteil, ihn glücklich zu machen. Am 16. August 2019 wurde Rüzgar diagnostiziert, SMA TYP 1. Ich kann das Gefühl nicht beschreiben und werde es auch nicht versuchen. Trotzdem sollten Sie eines wissen, der Satz ""Die Zeit heilt alles"" ist eine große Lüge. Ich weiß nicht einmal, was ich ihm sagen soll, wenn er mich jemals fragt: ""Warum ist das meinem Vater passiert""?Als Elternteil hatte ich Träume und Ambitionen für meinen kleinen Jungen und eine Wunschliste, die ich mit ihm zusammen als Familie erfüllen wollte. Allerlei Dinge von denen alle Eltern träumen mit Ihrem Kind zu tun, ""ihm das Fahrradfahren beizubringen"", ""gemeinsam Fußball zu spielen"", ""ihm das Autofahren beizubringen"", diese Dinge, von denen wir geträumt haben, scheinen für mein Kind jetzt sehr in die Ferne zu rücken... Denn wir wissen nicht, ob er es überleben wird. Wie soll ich bloß meinem kleinen Jungen nur beichten, dass meine rezessiven Gene mit einer Wahrscheinlichkeit von 25 % dazu geführt haben, dass er nicht mehr gehen, gerade sitzen oder sogar atmen kann? Wie werde ich ihm noch in sein Gesicht schauen können. Ich weiß es nicht. Ich hoffe, dass sie in Ihren Herzen erkennen können, dass durch jegliche Spende und die Verbreitung unserer Geschichte wir einen kleinen Schritt näher an die Rettung meines Sohnes gelangen.https://www.instagram.com/ruzgaryuruyecek/https://twitter.com/ruzgaryuruyecek/status/1240319001902960643?s=21Facebook: http://bit.ly/3a18FuT"	data/images/46218480_1584470948105893_r.jpeg

Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert (citeste scrisoarea in romana mai jos)I carried my baby boy for 9 months, waiting him to come in our lives and meet his older sister Emily. Robert was born on October 1st. When I first held him in my arms I knew what it was like to feel fulfilled. 4 years after giving birth to our little girl Emilia, God has blessed us with a little boy. I brought Robert home and our family was complete.One month after, at a doctor's check up, we were told that we should do a genetic test for something called ""spinal atrophy."" I knew that the biggest fear a parent can ever have is about to come true. Even though he didn't give us details, not to frighten us, with a simple Google search, we found: ""The number 1 genetic disease that kills most babies up to 2 years old.""I continued to read and I felt it in my bones that this was the disease that was affecting my child. I refused to believe, but I knew it was true. We did 3 genetic tests in different laboratories to be sure. Until we got the result, I was hoping that maybe it is something else, any other disease would be easier to treat than SMA Type 1, that is a death sentence.When I received the first result, I was devastated. I cannot describe what was in our soul. Emptiness... and all I felt was injustice ... and no, not injustice for us, but for him! All the abilities that all of us take for granted, like breathing, talking or walking, for Robert means a huge struggle.I felt injustice and concern for his future, especially in a society that does not make room for people with special needs. This disease is so rare that only 5 years ago scientists could find a way to stop it. Before that, children born with SMA Type 1 had no hope, their parents just had to see how each day their baby could move less until their last breath. They were bedridden, breathing and eating with the help of machines.SMA is a terminal muscle degenerative disease,affecting eating, talking, moving and even breathing. It results in muscle wasting where infants often die of respiratory failure or suffocation​ ​before reaching the age of two.With SMA Type 1 it's a race against time because each day means a loss of specialized nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and muscle cell death.There is no cure for SMA, but there is a treatment in the United States that stops the disease. As a gene therapy, ZOLGENSMA replaces the function of the missing or non-functioning SMN1 gene with a new functional copy of an SMN gene. Families that received the treatment say that this medicine was a miracle and some patients that received it early, even had complete rehabilitation and they can walk. It seems extremely unfair to think that life could have a price. But yes, his only chance is this vaccine that can stop the illness and costs $ 2.1 million. It is a huge amount, we never thought we would need to call for help, but this challenge is greater than we could have ever imagined.Due to the degenerative nature of the disease, we are racing against time and appealing to family, friends, local and global community to raise funds for Robert's gene therapy. As parents, we feel powerless because we can't afford to buy him this cure. I don’t know why life gives us such challenges, but I look into Robert's eyes and I know he came here for a reason. We would work as much as needed in order to gather this sum, but unfortunately there is a clock ticking and each day that passes, our son can loose some of his abilities and they can never be restored. No child deserves to suffer, all children deserve to live and make this world a better place!Please help us make his story known by sharing to your family, friends, and the world. Every dollar gets us closer to saving his life.______________________________________________________________________________Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert.Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita. La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit “amiotrofie spinala”. Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: “Boala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani”. Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate… si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta.Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert. Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ două treimi dintre toți copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator înainte de vârsta de trei ani.Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca viata ar putea avea un pret, dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina.Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata. Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!______________________________________________________________________________Это самое душераздирающее письмо, которое могла бы написать мать, но другого выхода нет и яделюсь историей моего малыша Роберта.Я носила под сердцем моего маленького мальчика в течение 9 месяцев, ожидая его прихода в наш мир и встречи с нами и его старшей сестрой. Роберт родился 1 октября в Кишиневе. Когда я впервые держала его на руках, я знала, какого это когда любовь переполняет тебя. Через 4 года после рождения нашей девочки Эмилии, Бог благословил нас маленьким мальчиком. Мы привезли Роберта домой, и наше счастье было безграничным.Через месяц после рождения, на приёме у врача нам сказали, что мы должны сделать генетический тест для определения диагноза «спинальная амиотрофия». Я знала, что самый большой страх, который я когда-либо чувствовала может оказаться правдой. Даже при том, что врач не хотел давать нам детали, чтобы не пугать нас, в поиске Google мы обнаружили: «Генетическое заболевание номер 1, которое убивает большинство детей в возрасте до 2 лет».Я продолжала читать и до мозга костей чувствовала, что именно эта болезнь, крадет моего сына, я отказывалась верить, но в глубине души я понимала, что это правда. Мы провели 3 генетических теста в разных лабораториях, чтоб убедится. Пока у нас не было результата, я надеялась, что это, может быть, что-то другое, любой другой диагноз было бы легче вылечить. Когда мы получил первый результат, на нас обрушилось небо. Единственное, что я чувствовала, это несправедливость ... и нет, не по отношению к нам, а к нашему ребенку! Все шаги развития , которые с рождения мы проходим естественным путем, для Роберта - это борьба. Роберт должен бороться каждую секунду, чтобы дышать, есть, чтобы двигать каждой частью своего тела. Я чувствовала несправедливость и беспокойство за его ускользающее будущее, особенно в обществе, которое не преспособленно для людей с особыми потребностями. 5 лет назад нигде в мире не было лекарства от этой болезни. Дети были прикованы к постели, они дышали и ели по средством мед оборудования. Но теперь надежда и шанс на нормальную жизнь есть.Спинальная амиотрофия поражает нейроны в спинном мозге, часто те, которые находятся в стволе мозга, что приводит к их смерти. Форма спинальной амиотрофии 1 является наиболее тяжелой с точки зрения эволюции и прогресса: около 2/3 всех детей с СМА типа 1 умирают от остановки дыхания до достижения возраста трех лет. Звучит как крик Небесам, думать, что жизнь может иметь цену, но да, его единственный шанс - эта вакцина которая может остановить болезнь и стоит она 2 100 000 долларов. Мы никогда не думали, что нам придется молить о помощь, но этот груз больше чем мы могли бы себе представить и осилить. Нет никакого другого лекарства, кроме как вакцина в Соединенных Штатах , котораяостанавливает болезнь. В качестве генной терапии ZOLGENSMA, предназначена для выявленияосновной причины мышечной атрофии позвоночника (SMA) путем замены функции отсутствующего или нефункционального гена SMN1 новой функциональной копией гена SMN.2 миллиона евро - это огромная сумма, мы не знаем, есть ли шанс собрать эти деньги, но мы знаем, что сила и доброта людей безгранична, и мы не хотим отказываться верить и бороться. Я не знаю, почему жизнь дает нам такие испытания, но смотря в глаза Роберту я знаю, что он появился на этот свет не зря и может стать доказательством чуда. Это страшно, но мой материнский оптимизм заставляет меня поверить , что если 2 миллиона людей пожертвуют каждый по 1 евро, то у Роберта будет шанс на жизнь.Не один ребенок не должен страдать и заслуживает шанс на жизнь чтоб сделать этот мир чуточкулучше!"	data/images/43935330_1575919276789097_r.jpeg

Our Work:Since 2005 Her Future Coalition has been creating powerful and positive change in the lives of girls who are survivors or are at high-risk of trafficking and gender based violence by providing education, including vocational training, safe shelter and a supportive community.Through these steps, we are able to break the cycle of poverty and exploitation for the most vulnerable girls and ensure a future of independence and wellbeing.About This Project:Education to prevent exploitation of the most vulnerable girls is more important than ever in the age of COVID-19. We are raising funds to provide flexible and accessible education to survivors of trafficking and gender violence and high-risk girls in red light areas and urban communities of Kolkata, India.India was in a strict, national lockdown for over two months, and rolling lockdowns continue in areas where the virus is most severe. This means that schools, and our red light resource centers, are not open at full capacity. We have had to find new and creative ways to keep our girls safe, fed, and continuing their educations, so that they are not trafficked or exploited in this especially difficult time.We will use the funds from this project both to protect and educate our girls NOW, and to ensure that they have educational opportunities in the LONG TERM. Without education, our girls have almost no hope of breaking the cycle of poverty and exploitation.• $10,000 will pay for Education Sponsorships, and help expand our computer training programs• $15,000 will pay for rent, teacher/tutor salaries and school supplies at our Red Light Resource Centers• $10,000 will pay for teacher/tutor salaries and school supplies for girls in urban slum areas• $5,000 will pay for emergency COVID-19 needs such as nutritious meals and food distributionDuring the Indian lockdown we shifted our needs to pay for distance learning given by cellphone, and plan to reopen our Red Light Resource Centers to a small number of girls at a time, so they can have a safe place to study and go online. (girls growing up in red light areas are particularly at risk in the afternoon and evening hours when their moms are seeing clients)The funds raised through this campaign will also enable us to provide education in the future. We will be able to provide education to 500-600 girls, with a full circle approach including after-school tutoring, safe places to study and rest, uniforms, books, school supplies, counseling and nutritious meals.How you can help:Please donate what you can to help these precious girls in Nepal and India!

CYO teammates. College roommates. Beach house buddies. Youth sports coaches, Boston refugees, co-workers and of course - Brian's incredible family. So many of us have shared the gift of Brian’s unbounded energy, kindness and humor.Whenever or however you met Brian, you’ve doubtlessly come to appreciatehow special he is. Brian brings endless fun and laughter to our lives. Be it a quick text, one of his amazing “you had to be there” stories, or a tip on the over/under for the Slustk vs. Minsk match in the Belarus Premier League (if one just happened to ask), Brian hasgiven us a lifetime of moments thatdemand a smile when we think of them.As most of you know from his incredible FB post, Brian has battled cancer for several years. He has endured numerous treatments, surgeries, progress and, sadly, setbacks. Despite the immense physical and emotional costs, Brian has been Brian: positive, optimistic and brave beyond measure. He has been focused on the present. He has been generous with his friends. Above all else, he has been dedicated to being a great father for Christopher, Daniel and Luke.Brian is continuing the fight, but the gravity of the situation is significant and we want to express our love and admiration for Brian and his family now. Brian is the beneficiary of this effort. The specific purpose of the GoFundMe is to fund a trust that Brian established for future college and emergency expenses for the boys. It will also give us a chance to express our gratitude for all he gave us.We realize that attaining our target goal will require an outpouring of generosity from a large network, but please know that any amount counts, big or small. We hope you will help make this a success.Sincerely,Grateful friends and family of Brian Murphy	data/images/48036420_1595459330197354_r.jpeg

During this period we received part funding from the Danish government which covered some of our running costs. That funding has now stopped.What is your donation for? We had hoped that by now we would have been fully open again, however as a center with about 90% of participants in our workshops coming from overseas, we are still deeply affected by the governmental travel restrictions. For our upcoming events, we have had to reduce the numbers of people who can attend and are not even sure that they will be able to go ahead, as we still do not know if the workshop leaders will be able to travel here.Your kind and important donation will help us through this uncertain time ahead. With an expected fall of approx 60 - 70% in revenue this year, your donation will help us to cover our ongoing running costs, which include mortgage payments, heating and maintenance, as well as refunds to guests for groups that we have to cancel. It will also, most importantly make sure that we are still here to welcome you and other guests in the future.Who we areSince 1986 Osho Risk has been holding meditation retreats, personal growth workshops and trainings inspired by the Indian Mystic Osho, whose vision was to make meditation accessible to everyone. The meditation center is run by a community of volunteers, living onsite and in the surrounding Buddhafield. We have supported thousands of people over the past 30 years to unlock past traumas, discover meditation and create a deeper sense of connection with themselves and others.How to donateYou are welcome to donate either through Go Fund Me or directly to our bank account using the details below.Sparekassen KronjyllandReg nr. 6128Account number 0015487186Swift KRONDK22IBAN DK1161280015487186	data/images/0.jpg

Minneapolis, MN	Kendrick Buffalo	$139,336	$200,000	86.0	We're raising money to rebuild MIGIZI Communications Inc.'s building and any donation will help make an impact to our mission of serving disadvantaged Native youth in and around the Twin Cities metro area.Early morning Friday, May 29th our building in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN (one street over from the 3rd precinct) went up in flames in the midst of ongoing protest over the senseless killing of George Floyd. As an organization and circle of support, MIGIZI is heartbroken over the tragic death of Mr. Floyd. We stand with the family and friends of Mr. Floyd, as well as with our African American brothers and sisters, and all the peaceful protesters. We too understand the rage and distrust others hold and have displayed. We've been fighting for justice and equality since 1977!As we drive for change, we now are faced with the task of rebuilding our sacred space to continue to serve our community, our future. We built this building last year with the goal and vision of creating a home for urban Native youths. Our community joined us in development meetings and conversations on what they wanted and what they needed to explore their potential. Upon opening in the summer of 2019, we were ecstatic to make quick use of our space. We hosted musical arts, media training, green energy training, graduations for our Native seniors, celebratory achievements in our community, and most importantly, our community members and their well-being.By supporting us, you invest in the future of our Native community.Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us and the Indigenous community!For more information about MIGIZI, please click on the following link to visit our organization's website.

We are also at a loss for words over the sudden passing of Tyler. The devastation and heartbreak caused by addiction is unfortunately becoming a reality for too many families across the United States as the epidemic of this disease continues to spread. That is why we are establishing the Tyler A.

It is our hope that this foundation can help, in any way, to lessen the burden of addiction for families like ours in the future.In lieu of flowers, as we are working to incorporate the foundation, we ask all donations be sent to this go fund me.

Our mission is to make a greater impact by building a better infrastructure for the people in the Kality area especially to enhance the living for women and children. Our join forces are a two-folded project. 1. A SCHOOL, ECO-VILLAGE CENTER, AND HEALTH CENTER There are two buildings on the 2500 square meter of land. Both buildings need a major restoration that includes a new restroom area and a kitchen. All four classrooms need new equipment from school benches to technical support for the teachers. This school will provide good education opportunities for 120 children who live in the area. We will build a new health center and have courses about preventative healthcare and family planning to empower the community. The experienced doctors and nurses at the health center will provide a range of healthcare services to people in the area. For other types of treatments, they will send the patients with the ambulance to a bigger Bambino Clinic. There will also be a lot of spaces to build an eco-village center for physical activity and cultivation plot for people from the community to plant everything from avocados, tomatoes, and mangos 2. BAMBINO CLINIC The second land, which is a ten-minute car drive away from the first land, will build a child and maternal health clinic. We will build this clinic on a 4000 square meter land and will support 5,000 patients per day. The clinic will include a secured infrastructure with security and roads. We will also build a Multifunctional building with a daycare center and emergency housing for women and children in danger. As you can see, there is plenty of support we need. We have already started by securing the land and now we can finally start building. Thank you for the donation! It means a lot and is a great opportunity to do a good thing for people who deserve a second chance of life. What is life without spreading positivity and tangible results for people on the human planet?

This pandemic is certainly affecting everyone in our country in one way or another. However, the Murabito kids, James 23, Katie 21 and Caroline 17, have lost their dad. Jimmy was on a ventilator in ICU for over 21 days, and although he received excellent care, it was not enough to save his life. The kids are devastated as they have lost their best friend, their role model, their rock, and their grounding force in an uncertain world.Jimmy had a successful small business in Harrison, NY, the town he was raised in and the town in which he raised his children. As a lifelong member of our community, MANY people know and care for Jimmy. So many people have been asking how they can help, and this fundraising effort is in response to the outpouring of support & concern for the Murabito children. Sadly, with the death of Jimmy, the children will no longer have the parental or financial support that he provided. It is our hope that the community will step up and help them during this time of uncertainty. Katie is accepted to Columbia University this fall for graduate school; Caroline will be a senior at Harrison High School next fall and will be applying to colleges. Although young adults, these kids have their whole lives in front of them, and the prospect of a life without their dad's love and support is daunting.Thank you in advance for your help, your support, and most importantly your continued love for James, Katie and Caroline at this very difficult time in their lives. If you would prefer to send a check to the kids, you can mail it to 35 Century Trail/Harrison/NY/10528 which is where they are currently residing: Thank you.	data/images/47311904_1586551990240271_r.jpg

Help to promote fair, effective and accountable policingBackground Who is StopWatch?StopWatch is a national research and action organisation that has been operating in the UK since 2010; it became a formal registered charitable organisation in 2015. StopWatch is a coalition of academics, lawyers, civil liberties activists, and community stakeholders that work to promote fair, effective and accountable policing for all.For the last decade StopWatch has been the leading independent voice on stop and search and disproportionate policing. The organisation formed in response to unprecedented increases in the number of stop-searches, consistently high disproportionality and government proposals increasing police powers and reducing accountability.We produce high quality research, briefings and resources gaining attention, credibility and trust from statutory, legal, academic and community stakeholders. Recent reports include Dr. Mike Shiner et al 'The Colour of Injustice: Race, Drugs and Law Enforcement'. Dr. Patrick Williams and Temi Mwale led on our 'Being Matrixed:The Over(Policing) of Gang Suspects' research. With emerging policing equipment and technology a concern, we published a briefing 'Call it Off: Are Police searching mobile phones illegally?'. More recently we wrote to a range of elected representatives and statutory bodies to inform them about the impact of COVID and the disparities in how communities are being policed, stopped and fined. A letter to the Independent Office of Police Conduct raising concerns about the disproportionate use of Tasers against black males was sent in response to recent incidents in Manchester and London. Keen to ensure that the voices of people impacted by adverse policing are heard, we have responded to consultations from the Home Office, College of Policing and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC). Last year we met with senior civil servants and special advisors to Prime Ministers May and Johnson. We were also invited to give oral evidence at the MacPherson 20 years On Inquiry.Utilising our strong community links, StopWatch also provides harm reduction services to young people and hosts a range of public events aimed at raising awareness and building community resilience. We assist community members, such as Neomi Bennet BEM, to challenge unjustifiable stops, searches and arrests by providing legal advice and much need pastoral support. The Y–Stop video linked with this campaign is a youth led creation that was made by StopWatch’s youth group and is aimed to empower other young people to confidently and safely engage with police.To address policing issues in the UK we have partnered with Release, Liberty, The Runnymede Trust, Amnesty International and have strong links with Big Brother Watch. StopWatch has participated in interviews for Channel 4, Sky News, ITV and the BBC and featured in articles in The Guardian, The Independent, The Daily Mail and The Observer.With no other civil society organisation solely focussed on disproportionate policing, StopWatch is providing scrutiny, applying pressure and using research and communities’ lived experiences to bring about meaningful and long-term reforms to policing. We believe that everyone should be treated fairly and with dignity by police officers .Call to Action - Donate Please!Following the tragic death of George Floyd in the USA, StopWatch has been contacted by many people wanting to know how they can provide support to organisations in the UK that focus on ensuring police accountability and promoting community empowerment. Being acutely aware of the plethora of policing issues that black communities face here at home in the UK, StopWatch has launched this fundraising page to make it easier for people in the UK to donate and support the essential work that we are doing. Whilst the situation in the USA is of great focus, we cannot express how much communities in the UK need your support! StopWatch has a long standing track record in this arena and is committed to challenging unfair policing and prompting positive community relationships. As a volunteer led organisation, we mainly rely on the generosity of trusts and grant funders to operate. We DO NOT accept funding from the government or police as we believe this would compromise our ability to critically challenge.With your donation we ensure that the great policy and important community work that we do continues to have a positive impact. Any financial assistance you can provide is greatly appreciated and will supports us to become more sustainable. Please DONATE and help spread the word.

While these impressive anecdotes are truly inspiring, widespread acceptance of this intervention is far from universal. In fact, due to a lack of peer reviewed clinical data, this powerful tool remains relegated to mere curiosity and is met with extreme skepticism. We’d like to change that, but we need your help to make it happen!Support us as we move the carnivore diet beyond anecdote to hard clinical data. We are embarking upon the first large scale modern clinical intervention trial on this remarkable dietary and lifestyle strategy. Your valuable support will ultimately affect millions of lives and dramatically alter our understanding of nutrition and how we manage chronic disease. This is a much needed step in further bringing this powerful intervention to the masses and the impact will be tremendous!The size and scope of the clinical trial will be dictated in large part by our budget and thus the following tiered goals are being projected. We anticipate a 6 month long study with either a single arm vs historical controls or a randomized control group pending funding.$200K- We can do a smaller sized study with limited number of participants and limited outcome measurements$500K-This level of funding allows for a far greater number of participants and a greater number of outcomes that we can assess.$1 Million- This level of funding allows us to do a very high level Randomized Control Trial of good size with robust outcome measures.Obviously, we’d like to do the highest quality and most impactful study that we can.

Im not quite sure what else to say here except that if you know him you know what this is in aid of and i hope you will help to keep that light from his soul to glow on us all one more night in these dark days.With the funds raised I plan to try and get public space for the statue and also to pay for any costs incurred for Bobs remembrance service, also I want to build a memorial garden.I also have two long term goals which I am now going to pursue in his honour which are to Start a trust or Foundation for those who have no voice, wether human or animal I want to be able to pay forward and help however I can.my other project will be about making a documentary series where each episode I will travel to a different city and sleep rough with the local homeless and explore how different societies view homelessness and how their respective governments try to deal with it in an effort to educate myself and the viewer about the realities of being out there in the world with no roof or hope.Bob has inspired me and I know many of you, so I feel this will be something you can all get behind and help to make real, I want to finally point out that I do not plan to use any of this money for myself except to cover the expenses of the projects and memorial funds, I have no need of it personally but I wanted the public to feel they are a part of Bobs legacy!!We hit £100.000 - This has blown me away, thank you all so much for your support, everything that comes in from now will be put towards the Trust on top of the funds left after we calculate the cost of his memorial and the documentary!!Also if you want to keep up to date with what I am doing then you can follow Bandit & Gizmo (Brothers of Bob) on Instagram & Facebook.I will be having a memorial service in June 2021 for the 1st anniversary of Bobs passing and will keep everyone posted for the details so you can all attend if you can!!Thank you  James Bowen	data/images/48861840_1592279398567652_r.jpg

Today we stand at a critical juncture in our collective history – things cannot continue the same after this moment. It is imperative we focus on what the production of knowledge looks like after this point. The Free Black University is a hub for radical and transformative knowledge production. The fight to decolonise education has been going on for years and it has become ever clearer that more is required than what the current education system can offer. Universities hold a deep responsibility when it comes to racism, the knowledge that introduced the very ideology of racism into our society was born in British Universities. The Free Black University exists to re-distribute knowledge and act as a space of incubation for the creation of transformative knowledge in the Black community. We firmly believe education should centre Black people healing and it should be free, anti-colonial, and accessible to all – so we will provide it. Further, the University is often a site of trauma for far too many Black students and so our project brings well being and the healing of our community to the fore.This project also brings climate justice to the fore as we recognise the relationship between the climate crisis and colonialism. Climate justice will run through all of the threads of our work as we centre structural and holistic approaches to preserving the world we all live in.We MUST engage critical thought in the wider mission for liberation and freedom, the world is ever changing, and the thought leaders of the next generation need deep and transformational spaces to develop their thinking in the face of the present challenges. The long-term vision for this work is to: 1) The transformation of minds is critical to the transformation of society and so we will specifically provide Black radical books to people right across the community who would otherwise not have access to it – this includes those incarcerated2) Deliver a range of open access and very accessible online lectures and teachings to the community exploring radical and transformational topics3) Create a space of community and care for Black students – there is a mental health crisis amongst Black students that universities are failing to sufficiently address. As an organisation healing is a foundational principle – this will be a space through which Black students can connect to various modes of support and healing work. mental health support and healing work. We will connect with Black therapists, counsellors, and community healers to offer a range of support to our community4) Build an open access, free, and expansive online library of radical readings writings from people across the world – we will no longer stand for the gatekeeping of knowledge for those who desire access to it5) Build a publication – the type of knowledge that is being produced will only ever be as radical as the ‘peers’ reviewing will allow it to be. Our journal, and later our Press, will centre radical and transformational thought that may not be respected under the current frame of knowledge. Our work will be driven by the radical Black imagination, it is all that can cut through Eurocentric thought. 6) A member’s space for emerging Black academics that need support and community during and beyond their academic journey7) A podcast that will explore complex and transformational ideas in accessible and simplistic ways – this podcast will speak to Black thinkers, organisers, academics, spiritualists, creatives, etc. The podcast is to allow absolutely anyone to tune in and learn something new about the history, present, and futures of Black liberation through a critical lens8) We will build a physical space – a hub for our work and a space for all Black people to access. This space will include; teaching rooms, a book shop, restaurant, and healing areas. The entire space will be created intentionally and in the interest of anti-colonial and healing work. 9) An annual conference that brings together Black radical thinkers (that are not only academics) to collectively produce knowledge and vision for Black liberation10) FREE AND ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION CENTRED ON THE FREEDOM OF BLACK PEOPLE WHICH NECESSARILY SUCCEEDS THE FREEDOM OF ALL PEOPLEWhat we are doing here is transformative – it has the potential to entirely transform the landscape of education and knowledge production. This world CLEARLY needs new and transformative ideas if we are to ever stamp out the visceral racism that exists across the world. Black thinkers and Black visionaries need to lead this intellectual revolution – the best way that we can do that is through creating intentionally anti-colonial and caring spaces for Black students to do this work. Let us show universities all over the world just what can be done when the agenda of Black liberation is at the heart of building spaces that produce knowledge and teach. This project is Black, queer, trans, anti-colonial, and revolutionary from its very heart. Help us bring this vision into fruition.What your donation could do:£15 will buy one book for people in the community £50 would pay for a podcast episode and equipment £150 would pay for a days work behind the scenes£200 would pay for one free admission to our annual conference£300 would pay for a collective healing session for Black students £350 would pay for one community radical workshop for Black folk to attend £500 would pay to create one publicly accessible lecture£1000 would pay for the process of publication for a journal article and building towards our University Press £50,000 is the suggested initial contribution from UK universities – this is less than the cost for two students to complete a 3-year degree – this money would go directly to the fund to build a physical spaceIf you have any enquiries please email us at [email redacted]	data/images/48521258_1591279360964812_r.jpeg

Covid-19 of 2020 caused my siblings to become deathly ill and some hospitalized for a significant length of time; thereby causing our family farm Circle “R” to horrifically suffer of non -operation. Also in our area the Cattle Stock yards and Meat Processing Centers were closed not allowing us to sell our livestock to maintain the farm. Therefore we had no resources to hire farm help to assist with maintaining the farm while my brothers were ill with Corona Virus. Additionally, monetary resources were loss from our crops production of not being able to be sold to local stores. To date, stores were not accepting locally grown crops not certified through USDA standards due Covid-19. Literally no resources are flowing our way to sustain his farm operation. Our goal is to raise $500k to retain the ownership and operation of our inherited family farm. Mr. Roberts is a 3rd Generation Farmer that operates and maintains the original 40 acres of land provided by the Land Allotment Act of Emancipation Proclamation. Mr. Roberts is trying to sustain his generational handed down land while simultaneously assisting his community to live healthier lives. This is done by providing his community with locally grown raised and harvested foods. This the best and cheapest way to go, since they are not factory farms that rely on artificial growth hormones and unnatural living conditions for the animals in order to maximize profits. As a local farmer he’s able to provide direct information when asked about his livestock, what they are fed, and their prices in order to determine what will best fit your family’s needs and budget.	data/images/48933938_1592508574463044_r.jpeg

The orphanage will house homeless and displaced children; offering shelter, safety, food, and care to children who would otherwise go without. As people of faith we have been given a charge to, “Open your hand freely to the poor and the needy” (Deuteronomy 15:11); especially to the orphan. This is an opportunity to do just that. Mercy Orphanage will have a memorial honoring Henry Carroll; as well as a plague with the names of all the donors who made this dream possible. This would include you and your families name.

Our Sisters will labour to cultivate love, unity and peace. We hope that, through God's grace, the monastery will mature into a welcoming haven for all those who seek to gain strength, encouragement and a renewal of their souls.Although founded by the Romanian Orthodox Church, the monastery is open to anyone, of any nationality, language, race, or age. The language which will be used during the services will be, depending on the congregation, Romanian and English, with some Greek, Russian, andevenIrish.The Property we hope to purchaseis located in the very heart of Ireland, in Shannonbridge, just a few kilometers away from the 6thcentury monastic site of St. Ciaran in Clonmacnoise. Ireland was famously abundant in monasteries, and the Irish landscape is sanctified by the ascetic laboursand constant prayer of countless monastics for hundreds of years in the first millennium. The place we wish to purchase has already been a place of prayer, being a retreat centre belonging to a Catholic religious community, consisting of a complex of 7 Scandinavian style wood houses on 3 acres of land.The Catholic Sisters have done all they can to ensurethattheir property,after sale,will become the Orthodox Monastery we intend, and I can not adequately express my heartfelt thanks for their understanding.They have lowered their asking price to an extent which has created a great opportunity for us - from the 450,000 euro the property was assessed at, down to 300,000 euro.Furthermore, initially we were required to pay the whole amount in one up-front payment, but the most recent good news is that we will be allowed to pay until the end of 2020. Nevertheless, our appeal is both urgent and necessary as we are seeking to buy the property AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HOW MUCH IS NEEDED?For all who want and can help us financially, we have set the goal of raising250,000 euro as soon as we can, since we already have 40,000 euro raised previously for the purpose of establishing such an Orthodox Monastery.Maybe it is just my imagination but I thought: if in all the world there are 250 people that can afford giving 1,000 euro each, OR 500 people giving 500 euro each, OR 1,000 people giving 250 euro each, OR 2,500 people giving 100 each…we will gather the whole sum in no time!WHY do we want to raise the money AS SOON AS POSSIBLE?There are two important reasons:·If we do not pay the full amount ‘up front' legally the sisters would remain the owners, and we, as mere tenants, by law, could not make the slightest change to the houses, the chapel, the fence and the gates etc. And we would really like to ensure that at the very least the chapel will look…Orthodox.·If we do not become legally the owners, the Order of Catholic sisters will have to bear the inconvenience of remaining the owners and the added administrative responsibilities of being landlords. So we are trying to avoid this, by getting all of money at once. We are sure they thought more of God than themselves in dealing with us and that they sincerely wished the place to remain a place of prayer, so we would greatly prefer to achieve our mutually compatible aims with the minimum of inconvenience.FOR HOW LONG are we fundraising?We will be fundraising on this online platform *** eitheruntil we have achieved our target of 250,000 euro,*** oruntil the end of 2020when we are supposed to make the last payment.BUTwe do HOPEagainst hope and beyond hope that, by the help of God, the Mother of God, all the Saints and byyour precious helpwe might be able to purchase the property in Octoberthis very year for the above-mentioned reasons. Please, help the miracle happen!So, Dear Friends, in summary ·I am a Romanian nun who is trying to raise 250,000 euro, ·Hopefully byOctober this year, ·In order to buy a property which will become an Orthodox Monastery in Ireland.As nothing is impossible with God, and as God works through people, please, could you become collaborators in this undertaking? - Be co-workers with God and with us founding this monastery to the glory of God and to the honour of the Mother of God and the Celtic saints of Ireland, who, let us not forget, did a great deal for Europe in the first ten centuries. We think it is about time we remembered them and knotted our loving relationship with them, as, isn’t that so, ‘God is wondrous in His saints’.- According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Orthodox Christians have been the fastest growing religion in Ireland since 1991. There were 62,187 Orthodox Christians in Ireland in April 2016 - up 37.5 per cent on 2011 (45,223) and over three times the number recorded in 2006 (20,798). We believe that the time is ripe for Ireland to have its own Orthodox Monastery.Even if you cannot immediately help, please join us in prayer, this is a very precious way to help which can work wonders and without which we cannot achieve anything.We are hoping that this cry for help might touch your hearts and meet God there, and may the Lord be the One that ‘will fight’ for us all, whose work we’ve seen and we feel.We accept with deep gratitude any contribution that comes from a compassionate and sincere heart, willing to render glory to God. And may the God of mercy reward you abundantly for your self-sacrificing generosity.*** Please help get the word out, you can share the link to this appeal to your Facebook Timeline!”PRAYERGod, You Who are everlasting and without beginning, You Who brought everything that is from nothingness into being, You Who dwell in the uncreated light, listen to our prayer at this hour and at any time we call on Your Name; mercifully look upon us, who, humbly and fervently worship You, and bless our holy wish to have, to Your glory and for the salvation of our souls, a monastery where we can praise You, O Lord, together with our fellow beings.You, Lord, Who in the beginning established the world through Your Word, have mercy on us and do not neglect our tears and speedily grant us a place where we can kneel down before You in prayer and welcome all those who need strength and renewal of their souls. For, the monastery, O Lord, belongs to those who seek You, to those born and unborn, and stands as a pillar and ground of our Orthodox faith.Send down to us the grace of Your All-Holy Spirit and chase away from among us the wicked, deceitful and quarrelling spirit, unite us into one heart and one mind, bless us in everything, grant us strength and energy, courage and growing into the fulfilling of our desire.For You are the One Who blesses, fulfills, and perfects everything, You our God, and to You we ascribe glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

For example through him, over 10,000 people in North America have entered Islam and have taken initiation in the Naqshbandi Order.One of the dear mureeds of Sheikh Nazim is our beloved Sheikh Hassan Dyck. Sheikh Hassan has been appointed as the wakil, the deputy of Europe.

Yemenis suffer from vulnerability due to hunger and malnutrition, and the whole nation suffers from the lack of immunity system, which is represented in the absence of a country that bears its national responsibilities.No resistance at the individual and national levels, which means that Yemen is easy prey to the fates of epidemics, how many epidemics overburden the developed world and place a heavy burden on the global economy?The most basic prevention methods recommended by the World Health Organization are a heavy burden for a war-torn people who are not well prepared.Time is critical, and Yemen is living in distress, which is the most suffocating around the world and in its history.Its need for help today is urgent. It is like resuscitating the patient in the most critical stages.Anyone who assists, regardless of the value, is tantamount to throwing the life-collar of a drowning man in trouble."	data/images/0.jpg

Dit was eerst een autogarage die we nu wat hebben omgebouwd tot een gebedsruimte waar we Elhamdoullilah onze gebeden kunnen verrichten en onze kinderen Arabische les kunnen geven.Helaas is deze moskee maar voor tijdelijk, wij huren dit van iemand, en wij willen graag ons eigen moskee bouwen.Ons verhaal is vorig jaar begonnen, zelf wonen wij meer dan 10 jaar in Hoogstraten zonder moskee. We zijn begonnen met een paar man en Elhamdoulilah zijn we inmiddels met 35 betalende leden in 1 jaar. We hebben nu 20 leerlingen die we Arabische les geven en er komen Elhamdoulilah steeds meer leden en leerlingen bij.Wat nu nodig hebben, is geld om de moskee te realiseren. Onze eigen plek. Deze last kunnen we alleen dragen met de hulp van alle broeders en zusters.Dus lieve broeders en zusters, help ons om moskee Tawheed te realiseren. `Wie omwille van Allah een moskee bouwt, voor hem bouwt Allah een huis in het paradijs'. Spoor met ons anderen aan om mee te helpen bij de realisatie van moskee Tawheed.Een sadaka aan de moskee is een sadaka jariya, wat jou jouw gehele leven hasanat zal geven.Investeer in de moskee, investeer in jezelf en je broeders en zusters. Wees gul en geef wat je kan geven. Moge Allah ieder rijkelijk belonen. Allahuma ameen.	data/images/48219510_1590064026519246_r.jpeg

Donate one brick for £50 and help us to make our vision for a new Masjid and Educational Centre a reality.Al-Mustafa Centre was founded 18 years ago in 2002. Fast forward to 2020 and we are a bustling community organisation based in the heart of Bradford.We have over 450 children studying in our Madrasah, Al-Mustafa Academy and over 200 adults studying in our adult wing, Bradford Muslim College. We offer facilities for daily prayers, jummah and regular events and seminars. We carry out interfaith work, youth and community engagement and have close working relationships with partners in the NHS, Police and Fire services.Our building is old, in a poor state of repair with bowing walls, damaged roofs, leaks and dry rot. Despite the difficulties our current building causes, we are at full capacity and so are no longer able to expand our services, meeting the ever increasing demand nor fit our activities into our current space. It is not financially viable to continue to spend thousands of pounds every year on repairing and maintaining a building which is not fit for purpose and can't meet the community's future needs.Our vision is to redevelop our site, creating a modern Masjid and community Centre. This would allow us to make use of space which currently houses single storey buildings to create a full 4 storey building which is future proof and fit to meet the growing needs of our community. It would give us more than double the amount of space that we currently have.We can't do this on our own. We have raised £250,000 so far, but cannot start construction until we have raised 50% of total costs, so need to raise another £150,000 by the end of 2020.We have set a target of £50,000 through our social media pages and are asking our friends to contribute to this project and help us to fulfil our vision for our Masjid .Please share our campaign with your friends and family and help them earn the reward of supporting this project. You will earn an equal share of the reward for anybody who donates a brick due to you telling them about this project!May Allah accept it and grant us tawfeeq to reach our goal with pure intentions and the himmah to fulfil them.	data/images/0.jpg

The construction began in 2018 and the project is about 80% through with the Masjid taking shape, complete with minarets and dome.The final vision for the Masjid is to be a house of worship and a community center. Where we come to practice and learn our faith and also to be a social hub for the Muslim community in the area.The target for this campaign is to raise $130,000 to complete the exterior brick and stucco work. This will enable us to move to the final phase of the project which is the interior of the Masjid.Your donation will be a great help in getting this project to the finish line and support the Muslim Society of Rhode Island to continue its journey of spreading goodness, improving lives, and changing hearts!For further details on this project, please feel free to contact us:        Current Masjid Address:       18 Dunnell Lane       Pawtucket,RI 02860        New Masjid Address:        665 Central Ave        Pawtucket, RI 02861        Phone:    401-729-0745        Email:    [email redacted]        Website: www.masjidalrahmanri.comMay Allah The Most Exalted shower His unbounded blessings on you and your family.	data/images/47538434_1587797067224101_r.jpeg

I wanted to let you know that in spite of the COVID19 pandemic, Crossreach remains connected to the community, sourcing much needed supplies and making deliveries. This is such a critical time to help those who are unable to help themselves. Stay safe and healthy and thank you so much for your donations.My fiancé, Steve Crane, and I are heart broken about the devastation Hurricane Dorian brought to our beloved Northern Bahamas. Grand Bahama Residents urgently need your generous help to source and deliver aid.Steve has lived in Freeport, Grand Bahama for over 50 years. We are raising funds for Crossreach which is a Lucaya Presbyterian Church outreach ministry that was established over 20 years ago. The ministry stages food and necessities for ongoing distribution to some of the island’s most needy residents living in Gold Rock to the East, and Freeport, Lewis Yard and the Eight Mile Rock settlements to the West. Many recipients do not have the ability to get to a relief distribution location. The food and necessities purchased with your contributions will be sourced in the U.S., safely shipped to Grand Bahama and distributed by Crossreach directly to those in the greatest need.Crossreach is supported by the LPC congregation and many other individuals throughout the community. It is a well-established ministry. Crossreach coordinates four teams of volunteers to normally distribute food each month and has volunteers who know the settlements well. Steve heads up one of the volunteer teams. The ministry has a donated warehouse facility to securely receive and collate supplies and no administrative overheads so every penny donated goes straight to the most needy without deduction.

He was that guy who would call just to see how you’re doing and make sure everything was great in your life. Justin was so excited when he told me that Kate was pregnant and they were having a baby. Unfortunately after a horrific accident at work on Wednesday he will never have the opportunity to meet his son. Justin was not just a fantastic golf professional, but he was a special person to everyone he came in contact with. We’re raising funds to help Kate and the kids get through these awful times and to start a college fund for the kids. Please consider donating as much as you can, Justin would be the first one signing up to help anyone else out. Justin was an Assistant Golf Professional at Aronimink GC, Wilmington GC, and Gulph Mills GC. He was also the Head Professional at French Creek GC before becoming the Director of Golf at Philmont CC.	data/images/48529266_1591224728597608_r.jpeg

She loves performing, including playing football. She is a gentle soul and is loved so much by all her family, especially mummy and daddy, brother Charlie and their dog Coco.​​Unfortunately, on 27th November 2019 life changed forever as the family received the devastating news that Edie has an aggressive Brain Tumour called DIPG. ​As you can imagine, this is truly the kind of news that brings the entire family to its knees and leaves them fearful for the future.​​But, while they will face many physical, emotional and financial challenges, the gloves are off and the entire family are ready for the fight that lies ahead!​​They are an extremely close and proud family so the decision to start the fund is not an easy one, but they are going to need financial support to fight and get the best medical help and treatment possible, to make sure Edie wins her battle.Any money raised will initially help with any additional medical visits and treatment, physical therapy and possible clinical trial logistics which is something the family are already exploring.​We are aiming to raise as much money as possible and by donating, no matter how big or small, you will help ease the financial burden on the family so that they can just focus on being present with Edie and face this challenge head on. ​​​All money raised will go directly to the Jackson family and the care of Edie and they are so unbelievably grateful.Any money not used by the family will be donated to a suitable DIPG charity to raise much needed awareness and work towards a future where children and their families do not have to suffer at the hands of this awful disease.Please follow Edie's Fight on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/439224763687582/Thank you xx	data/images/43801794_1575288936239027_r.jpeg

When he did not return in the time frame expected, his family became concerned. A couple family members went looking for him and called police due to the time and his errand location corresponding with the mass shooting that was happening in Nova Scotia. Joey was missing for several hours before the family learned that he was indeed one of the victims who was killed.Joey left behind his partner, Shanda MacLeod and their two beautiful daughters. He is also survived by his teen daughter, his father, sister, brother-in-law, niece and nephew. Joey was currently out of work due to the recent shut down of the pulp mill affecting many who work in the forestry industry. Edited to add: He had just started back to work on Friday, April 17. Joey was the sole provider for their family, which leaves Shanda and her girls in a financially hard place on top of the tragedy that has occurred.We, Shanda’s family, are asking for donations for burial or cremation costs initially. All money raised above that will go directly to Shanda and the girls for current and future living expenses so Shanda does not have to rush out to look for work (she really can’t during this pandemic), but can continue to stay-at-home with the girls while they grieve their loss. Beyond that, we are hopeful that they gather a little nest egg for the girls’ future education as well.Thank you all for reading, sharing and helping our sister and daughter out. We appreciate it from the bottom of our hearts. Please share this GoFundMe page link to help spread the word!Thank you to our kind and caring community who have already been reaching out to our families.God bless you!	data/images/47537342_1587432651752675_r.jpeg

A regressive genetic Illness which is always fatal and results in gorgeous children progressively losing all of their skills and becoming increasingly unwell until they pass away in late childhood. While we were learning to live with ours girls diagnosis and choosing to make the most of the time we have with her we then tested our other two children Billy and Alice.In February 2020 we received more devastating news that our gorgeous Billy also has Juvenile Tay Sachs and will also beginto decline like we have seen with Maggie.Since Maggie’s diagnosis she has lost her ability to talk, to toilet independently, to eat and also now to walk. Maggie has become wheel chair dependent and has seizures everyday.Billy is starting to have some difficulty with his speaking and is starting to trip oversometimes.Alice does not have Tay Sachs however faces her own challenges growing up with older siblings who are gradually losing the skills they have developed.We have been completely overwhelmed at the support and love we have receivedby every body in our lives while we have grappled with our grief. We are also full of gratitude for the beautiful children we have and every day we are given to hold them in our arms.Every single person we come across haveoffered to support us and the time has come for us to ask for help, even though it is an uncomfortable position to be in!We need to purchase a car to have modified to enable us to transport two children in wheelchairs! While we are lucky that NDIS will most likely fund the modification we need to buy a new car for them to modify. This is certainly not something we had planned for or expected. We are reaching out and asking for help from anyone who might be in a position to do so.Any contribution would be incredible and will mean that we will be able to get thecar we need to transport our beautiful family around and keep having adventures and making memories that we will treasure for the rest of our lives! It will also mean that as my children get more unwell I might be in the fortunate position to have some time off work and care for them when they most need their mum and when I most need to be right by their side!Finally Rory and I want to thank everyone for taking the time to read our story and for always thinking of us! At times when our grief feels almost overwhelming it is the love of our family and friends that picks us up and keeps us going! X	data/images/48184652_1589927487687831_r.jpeg

In the city of Los Angeles, we need to come together as one community and do everything we can on the ground to supplement, support and reduce risk to every community member and community in this city. Especially since there is a glaring absence of federal, state or city governments enacting the sweeping structural changes and safety nets that we critically need.We are creating a COVID19 LA Mutual Aid Community Network, comprised of different grassroots organizations, movements and organizers, who are committed to organizing material support in the community. We are immediately providing grocery and supply deliveries, and are preparing to expand this to other community support services like running errands, dog walking, childcare, caregiving, and mental health support for those impacted by the pandemic.If you are reading this, we implore you to donate today, sign up to volunteer, or sign up to receive assistance: Mutual Aid LA. We have an incredible opportunity to crack open our culture of silence and offer our community love, support, and aid.The most freeing and radically kind thing we can do right now, to fight the system and protest the lack of care for all those struggling, is to come together and support each other.This is a community network of solidarity. We hope it will grow in terms of groups and individuals joining the network, as well as broadening the support from delivery supply and in-home services to the growing network coming together to protect workers, demand paid time off, quarantine pay, eviction moratoriums, and other human rights that will need to be met in this crisis. We have a lot of communities in our city who are extremely vulnerable-- the undocumented, disabled, elderly, houseless, housing insecure, sex workers, healthcare workers, and more. We also know that in our current housing crisis, homelessness crisis, and at the larger intersection of class struggle, systemic poverty affects every single community and will be compounded by this pandemic. We need your support more than ever.Where will the money go?Groceries*, supplies, direct-aid to keep people in their homes(Each supply delivery is up to 50 dollars at least for groceries and basic household goods.)Who are we?Even though we are a non-profit every single dollar will go to direct mutual aid support.Your donation is tax-deductible – our non-profit tax ID 65-1208274	data/images/46180116_1586145978747782_r.jpeg

A grassroots organizing collective for and by Black trans/queer youth to organize for our collective liberation using art, direct action & political education. For 5 years we have operated as a volunteer collective. We've organized rally's and vigils to uplift trans and gender non conforming folks lost to state or interpersonal violence. Hosted countless workshops and trainings to educate our community. And coordinated direct support to folks experiencing housing/food insecurity, incarceration and immigration detention. We have done all of this work without exceeding a budget of $50,000 a year. Now we find ourselves called to rise up and take action like never before. Our Black trans and queer communities have been disproportionately impacted by the issues that are ravaging our society today. Racism, transphobia, COVID-19, rising rates of unemployment and job loss, housing insecurity, police and interpersonal violence and so much more. We are asking for your help to make a major investment in our youth led, Black trans/queer organizing work that is vital to the health and well being of our communities. We are raising $100,000 so that we can stand up and fight back! We aim to expand our mutual aid work, coordinate direct actions that center and uplift Black trans lives, to increase our educational capacity to train the next generation of youth activists, and increase our support for incarcerated trans folks fighting to survive in U.S prisons, jails & detention centers.The funds will be used as follows:  --$50,000 for bail funds, legal fees and food/ride share support for Black trans/queer youth in NYC (50%) --$20,000 to build out organizing and arts mentorship program for Black trans/queer youth in NYC (20%) --$15,000 to send commissary funds to incarcerated or detained Black trans/queer young folks nationally (15%) --$15,000 to continue mutual aid micro grants program to Black trans folks impacted by COVID-19 nationally (15%)To create a world where #BlackTransLivesMatter we need to organize around the issues that impact our communities while we are still here! We need to create the conditions for our communities to THRIVE, not just survive.Young people, particularly young Black trans/queer people have been some of the world's most valuable contributors to movements for racial and gender justice across human history. Unfortunately, for far too long our work has gone under-resourced and overlooked.During this moment of reckoning in our country the Black Excellence Collective is answering the call to fight for our freedom.

Many New Yorkers are very sick, out of work, have depleted their savings, and are in dire need of feeding their families. Food banks are overwhelmed, undersupplied and are forced to turn families away empty handed, leaving them on the brink of starvation.At the same time, farmers are having their vegetable crops go to waste as restaurants are closed and supply chains have broken down. There is more than enough food, but it is not in the right places. This is a problem that we can help solve together, right now. And we invite you to help.We are mobilizing a bootstrapped effort to transport food from farmers to food banks in the NY area.One of the poorest districts in New York City is in the South Bronx. East Side House Settlement serves this community. Executive Director Daniel Diaz informed us that they need food to feed more than 5,000 families in his community immediately.

This is a community-led fundraiser to help Cobargo manage its recovery and ensure the village not only survives this disaster but can thrive.Cobargo was overwhelmed by a massive firestorm on New Year’s Eve. Three people died in the conflagration and a fourth person died later in hospital. At least 110 homes were destroyed, many more properties badly damaged, our farms have been devastated, thousands of native animals killed, our forests burnt and the historic heart of our beautiful village was razed to the ground. The neighbouring village of Quaama and localities, including Yowrie, Wandella, Verona, Coolagolite and Dignam's Creek, were similarly fire ravaged.Cobargo needs to restore the morale and confidence of its community, help people deal with the long-term trauma of these fires, restore the local economy and local jobs, and regenerate our natural environment. We are in touch with other communities that have been through such fires during Ash Wednesday, Black Saturday, the Canberra Fires and Tathra. They tell us that recovery can take as many as ten years and more, that government and institutional support lasts only for a short time after the event and communities with their own funds have the capacity to keep on supporting their people for the long haul.We already know that mental health is going to be a key issue for us. Many of the relief organisations that provide mental health support are already visiting our area to provide services but we know that our people are turning to their existing community groups for support - sports groups, music groups, social networks, the volunteer groups they are already involved in. We are looking at practical ways to sustain these groups during the recovery. The aim is to aid community recovery by supporting the community networks that provide the social support we all rely on so much in the bush.Our rebuilding must also be a reimagining - we want to implement more sustainable solutions for energy usage, including a village micro-grid. We want to manage our environment better, improve the readiness of our village and localities to deal with future disasters. Our aim is to ensure that we emerge from this tragedy as a stronger, regenerative community, guided by regenerative principles. We need your help to do this.The Cobargo Community Bushfire Recovery Fund Inc has been set up by four of Cobargo's leading not-for-profit community groups: the Yuin Folk Club Inc, which produces the annual Cobargo Folk Festival; the Bowerbird Opportunity Shop; the Cobargo Cooperative Society Ltd and the Cobargo Show Society Inc, which runs Cobargo's annual agricultural show. The fund is run by community volunteers, so overheads and admin costs will be kept low. Projects will be identified through community consultation; developed and implemented by local people, drawing on expert help as needed. This group will support the community discussion on the future of our village.The fund will be managed transparently and fully audited. Each of these organisations are run by reputable committees and all have a history of giving back to the community. Safeguarding the reputations of our village and our parent organisations by ensuring this fund is properly managed is a priority.While we are shattered by what has happened to our region, we are full of hope for the future.All enquiries, including media, to [email redacted]All contributions, big and small, welcomed.

Their family members are losing their chance to say goodbye to loved ones because hospitals aren’t allowing visitors due to the crisis. There is story after story of family members calling to hospital staff in an effort to speak to their sick family members and they don’t always get through in time.On March 27th, Sara Rodell received a text from a friend trying to get tablets to the New York Nurses Union for this exact reason. Hospital staff had begun to use their personal devices to give family members a chance to say goodbye to critically ill patients. But personal devices of staff members aren’t enough, not everyone has a smartphone - and this shouldn’t be the way people lose their last moments with loved ones.That’s how we began the work of finding smart devices and getting them in the hands of hospital workers to connect families.Everyone deserves the dignity to say goodbye. And surviving family members need that goodbye moment to hold onto.It’s a big problem, and it’s getting bigger.40 hospitals in the New York area have already requested devices from us and we’re in the process of securing devices for them. We’ve seen 3,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the US (as of March 31, 2020) and the number keeps on rising. This crisis isn’t over and there are 6,000 hospitals in the United States that could use the help. We are raising $1,000,000 in partnership with our fiscal sponsor, The Giving Back Fund, to purchase 10,000 tablets to deliver to the hospitals and nursing homes most in need. These tablets will have Zoom, Messenger, WhatsApp and Skype installed to make it easier for patients and their loved ones to connect directly.Here's how it works:1. Donated devices are shipped to Loop & Tie’s distribution centers.2. We match devices with hospitals and hospice centers in need.3. Donated devices are shipped out to eligible hospital programs.4. Family members get a chance to say goodbye.100% of donations will be used to purchase and ship devices.Thank you in advance for your generous donation.With love and support,Sara RodellBenish ShahAnjali KumarChristina WallaceKristina LibbyGreg WongRaj SuriStacy RademacherJoanne Gould Kuntz MDMargaret StewartEileen Toback, NY Professional Nurses Union (NYPNU)Wendy R AndersonKatie Stanton###WAIT - I HAVE QUESTIONS.

The need is high and we are prioritizing public hospitals based on: (1) first come first served, (2) the concentration of cases in city/state; (3) the number of units requested; and (4) whether the request source can be verified. We are working with an independent consultant with years of experience in the healthcare industry to review submissions that meet the criteria.Wait, why wouldn’t patients have their own smart devices?Many patients arrive through the ER and have left their phones at home. Others don’t have access to their phones because it is with personal belongings and the battery has died. Doctors and nurses don’t always have access to the patient’s personal belongings and even if they could access the smart device, they may not have the passcode.Can I donate my personal device?Right now we’re delivering batches of clean devices pre-loaded with the right software to the hospitals. Individual devices aren’t being collected to ensure that every device sent to the hospital is in good condition and is ready to go upon arrival.I’m a hospital worker and we need devices.Unfortunately, this pandemic knows no boundaries. If you’re a hospital and nursing home and want to connect, please complete our device request form. Requests are reviewed on a rolling basis. For more information, find us at CovidTechConnect.Is my donation tax-deductible?Yes. COVID Tech Connect is a fiscally-sponsored project at THE GIVING BACK FUND, INC., a nonprofit corporation with tax exemption status from the IRS under code 501c3.Why did you pick this organization?The Giving Back Fund is a reputable fiscal sponsor for philanthropic projects. Our team of volunteers is partnering directly with them to handle fundraising for this initiative.What happens to the tablets after the crisis passes?Hospitals and nursing homes will be able to utilize the tablets for patient communication beyond the COVID-19 crisis. The devices will allow patients to stay in touch with their families throughout their care and recovery.	data/images/47088294_1585843161309315_r.jpeg

Il nostro sudore è uno degli ingredienti della vostra dieta giornaliera. Ogni mattina ci alziamo all’alba, ci spacchiamo la schiena nei campi per tutto il giorno e torniamo la notte a dormire nei nostri tuguri, nelle nostre baracche e nei casolari fatiscenti.Oggi, abbiamo bisogno di voi e della vostra generosità. Siamo degli esseri umani, con uno stomaco quasi sempre vuoto, e non solo braccia da sfruttare. Nel mezzo di questa pestilenza mondiale -con il dramma quotidiano di contagi e la straziante strage silenziosa che ogni giorno ci porta via i cari senza poterlisalutare e abbracciare - scopriamo che siamo tutti uguali e accomunati dalla stessa angoscia, paura, dolore e lutto. Il denaro e la tecnologia avevano illuso l’umanità che era diventata invincibile, capace di padroneggiare lo spazio e di domare il tempo. Però, la morte, che bussa quotidianamente alle nostre porte distruggendo famiglie intere, ci ricorda che varchiamo il confine della vita, sia in entrata che in uscita, sempre soli e senza niente. Per questo, la vita umana rimane il dono più prezioso. Ci dicono, giustamente e con ragione, di stare chiusi in casa per sconfiggere questo nemico invisibile. Ma se noi non usciamo non faremo mangiare tante persone tra cui i medici e infermieri in trincea. Lavoriamo senza guanti, senza mascherine e senza distanziamento. Per molti di noi non ci sono sussidi, congedi o cassa integrazione. Per noi ci sono solo gli stenti del duro lavoro e le malattie respiratorie, osteomuscolari, grastrointerinali. E ora anche il terrore del coronavirus.Forse sono in questi momenti difficili, quando gli esseri umani si accorgono della propria fragilità, che diventa più facile guardare verso il basso, nei bassifondi dell’umanità, e udire il grido di dolore dei lavoratori della terra. Ed è per questo che lanciamo oggi un appello affinché possiate farci una donazione che ci consentirà di portare cibo e diritti anche sulle nostre tavole.________________________________Sono Aboubakar Soumahoro e ho lanciato con alcuni compagni questa raccolta fondi.Aiuteremo tutte le persone che in questo momento sono in difficoltà. Braccianti, zappatori, lavoratori della terra che raccolgono cibo ma che hanno lo stomaco vuoto. Verranno acquistati presidi medici e sanitari per la sicurezza dei lavoratori della terra. Ad iniziare dalle mascherine.Poi verranno acquistati cibo, alimenti e beni di prima necessità per tutti. E tutto quello che servirà per espletare il proprio lavoro e promuovere ogni diritto umano. I soldi saranno prelevati su un conto dedicato appositamente a questa raccolta fondi e saranno destinatiinteramente alle persone in difficoltà.* * *FRANCAISNous apportons de la nourriture à votre table mais pourtant, nous avons faim.Nous sommes Paola, Abdul, Michele, Mamy, Patrizia et bien d'autres travailleuses et travailleurs invisibles. Nous sommes celles et ceux qui plantons et cueillons les fruits et légumes que vous trouvez sur vos tables. Notre sueur est l'un des ingrédients de votre alimentation quotidienne. Chaque matin, nous nous levons à l'aube, nous nous brisons le dos dans les champs toute la journée et nous nous rendormons la nuit dans nos taudis, nos cabanes ou nos fermes en ruine.Aujourd'hui, nous avons besoin de vous et de votre générosité. Nous sommes des êtres humains, pas seulement des bras à exploiter et nous avons un estomac presque toujours vide.Au milieu du fléau mondial actuel - avec le drame quotidien de la contagion et le massacre silencieux qui nous enlève chaque jour nos proches sans pouvoir les saluer ni les embrasser - nous découvrons que nous sommes toutes et tous pareils et unis par la même angoisse, la même peur, la même douleur et le même deuil.L'argent et la technologie avaient trompé l'humanité qui se croyait invincible, capable de maîtriser l'espace et d'apprivoiser le temps. Cependant, la mort, qui frappe quotidiennement à nos portes, détruisant des familles entières, nous rappelle que nous traversons la frontière de la vie, soit pour y entrer soit pour y sortir, toujours seuls et démunis. C'est pourquoi la vie humaine reste le don le plus précieux.On nous dit, à juste titre, de rester enfermés dans nos maisons pour vaincre cet ennemi invisible. Mais si nous ne sortons pas, nous ne donnerons à manger à personne, y compris les médecins et les infirmières dans les tranchées qui en ont tant besoin. Nous travaillons sans gants, sans masques et sans distance de sécurité entre nous. Pour beaucoup d'entre nous, il n'y a pas d'avantages extra-légaux, pas de droit aux congés ou d’indemnités de licenciement. Pour nous, il n'y a que les difficultés du travail et les maladies respiratoires, squeletto-musculaires, grastro-intestinales. Et maintenant, la terreur du coronavirus.C'est peut-être en ces temps difficiles, lorsque les êtres humains prennent conscience de leur propre fragilité, qu'il devient plus facile de regarder les bidonvilles de l'humanité et d'entendre le cri de douleur des travailleurs et travailleuses de la terre.C'est pourquoi, nous vous invitons aujourd'hui à faire un don qui nous permettra d'apporter de la nourriture et des droits à nos propres tables.* * *ENGLISHWe bring food to your table, yet we are hungryWe are Paola, Abdul, Michele, Mamy, Patrizia and many other invisible workers. We are the ones who plant and pick the fruits and vegetables you find on your tables. Our sweat is one of the ingredients in your daily diet. Every morning, we wake up at dawn, break our backs in the fields all day and go back to sleep at night in our slums, shacks or ruined farms.Today we need you and your generosity. We are human beings, not just arms to be exploited, and our stomachs are almost always empty.In the midst of today's global scourge - with the daily drama of contagion and the silent slaughter that takes away our loved ones every day without being able to greet and embrace them - we discover that we are all the same and united by the same anguish, the same fear, the same pain and the same grief.Money and technology had fooled humanity, which believed itself invincible, capable of mastering space and taming time. However, death, which knocks daily on our doors, destroying entire families, reminds us that we cross the frontier of life, either to enter or to leave, always alone and without anything. That is why human life remains the most precious gift.We are rightly told to stay locked up in our homes to defeat this invisible enemy. But if we do not come out, we will not feed anyone, including the doctors and nurses in the trenches. We work without gloves, masks and a safe distance between us. For many of us, there are no extra-legal benefits, no leave entitlements or severance pay. For us, there are only the difficulties of work and the respiratory, osteomuscular, grastro-intestinal diseases. And now the terror of the coronavirus.Perhaps it is in these difficult times, when human beings become aware of their own fragility, that it becomes easier to look at the slums of humanity and hear the cry of pain of the workers of the land.That is why we are inviting you today to make a donation that will allow us to bring food	data/images/47126108_158584051952044_r.jpeg

The conditions and treatment of people in jail is violent and cruel. This is especially true during the current COVID-19 pandemic.With local, state and federal agencies failing our communities and continuing to lock people up, we will resist by bailing people out!In the past few months, FANG has bailed out several people with our limited funds. We have been receiving calls from people inside and will continue to bail people out as funds roll in. The FANG Collective, based in Rhode Island, started its Shut Down ICE campaign in August 2018. As the campaign has progressed, activists have also gone through the long and drawn-out process of the legal system. After spending days in the New Bedford District Court, we witnessed the countless attacks on poor and working-class people and those most impacted by systems of oppression in our community.As we have moved through the courts and jails, we have met people, heard their stories, and have tried our best to support victims of state violence captured in the deportation and incarceration machine. We have developed relationships both with people on the inside and with lawyers in the area who are connecting us to people who need bail support.Our campaign is based in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Thomas Hodgson, the county Sheriff, has a tremendous amount of power and is a violent racist and close friend of President Trump. He continues to publicly refuse to release people from detention and incarceration during the COVID-19 outbreak, despite known cases in the Bristol County House of Correction. Facing tremendous public and legal pressure, a federal court has ordered over 43 people released from the Bristol County House of Corrections, but this is still not enough.Please support our efforts by donating to FANG’s Bail FundOnce we receive funds the money will go toward bailing people out of Bristol County House of Correction and the Ash Street Jail and other locations on a case by case basis. Once people show up for their court hearings and their case is finalized, we get the money back and can continue to cycle it through to get more people out!The FANG Collective is a community organizing and direct action group that has been a part of campaigns for climate justice, indigienious sovereignty, prison abolition and resisting ICE.If you have any questions, you can email us at: [email redacted]	data/images/47111096_1586907808727213_r.jpeg

Without them, we lose some of the very things that make us who we are.Right now we are responding to a crisis. It threatens those who are most vulnerable and precious. This virus could decimate a generation of Native Elders and destroy a rich culture that has been passed down for countless generations.Native Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in across America.Lack of running water, infrastructure, and health risk factors make the situation even more difficult. Given the higher health status enjoyed by most Americans, the lingering health disparities of American Indians and Alaska Natives are troubling.Protect Native Elders remains focused to support tribes across the United States. As COVID-19 devastates Indian country, new requests for unmet needs keep coming in daily: from the Pacific Northwest groups such as the Spokane Tribe of Indians to Southwestern nations such as Navajo and Zuni, to the Sioux nations in the Dakotas and the tribal groups in New York and New Jersey.Please help us preserve the native elders, native wisdom, and support us in providing PPE essentials and supplies to these and other indigenous communities!	data/images/0.jpg

Fort Worth, TX	Pat Pelletier	$155,860	$500,000	320.0	"On June 4th, 1984, a small group of very nervous volunteers, led by Chuck Pelletier, opened the doors of Mother and Unborn Baby Care’s Pregnancy Center for the very first time, to welcome those scared and vulnerable women who were pregnant and seeking abortions. Working together, they have seen over 60,000 people and saved over 8,500 babies whose Moms were pregnant and seeking abortions. It has been 35 years since that day and Mother & Unborn Baby Care is continuing to fight for the lives of these precious babies, and supporting their worried and frightened Moms. We never abandon our clients, and our services are always offered for free. We have regularly provided transportation, rental assistance, utility assistance, counselling, medical service referrals, material assistance (including clothing, formula, diapers, cribs, and so much more), and financial support to help clear the barriers that our clients face that make their pregnancy a crisis in their eyes.After leading the efforts of Mother & Unborn Baby Care (MUB) for over 32 years, Chuck died in 2016, leaving the work of the Center to the newly hired Director, the volunteers, and his wife, Pat. The center is growing and getting busier all the time, with a sonographer on staff and new volunteers coming in for training. They have outgrown their present location and need a larger facility to serve the women and the families they will see in the future. And so MUB has begun a fundraising campaign to make it possible to re-locate the Center in a larger, and more accessible location. We are in desperate need for financial support in the very near term, as we will begin construction on the new center location in the upcoming weeks. Please help us continue our work of saving the lives of the innocent and supporting both mother and child in every way imaginable, for as long as they need us.If you would like to establish a recurring monthly payment to help support our ongoing operations, please text ""give"" to 817-631-2266 and follow the link. Every penny goes to support women in extreme crisis and to save the lives of innocent children."	data/images/42601736_1596061845718139_r.jpeg

Still with a focus on delivering to seniors during this crisis we are now also committed to Veterans, First responders, frontline health workers and children as well as families. We want to keep our employees active, and help them feed their families. The positive demand has been incredible! Our initial plan to 100% self fund is not doable if we want to reach more families (thousands more per day)--but we will continue to absorb any costs we can. None of these funds will be used in any type of profit mode or monies to ownership. It will all be used for feeding those in need! As we plan on expanding these services through our network of schools we will need additional resources. We want to continue getting as many meals to as many families in need but we need your help. Please consider donating anything to this wonderful cause. $1, $5, anything will help. Our lone goal during this extremely difficult time is to provide the community with a hot, healthy meal.

Courtesy of the Chinese-American Planning Council.)We've turned Heart of Dinner(formerly Table to Table NYC) into a relief efforts hub providing comforting meals for those most vulnerable in/near the Chinatown area with a heavy focus on the homebound elderly. We are especially reminded of our immigrant grandparents who would have had difficulty asking for help during these times because of language and cultural barriers.

Your kind contributions allow us to adapt and scale to meet the needs of various organizations and continue providing meals for the underserved in densely populated Asian neighborhoods like our elderly and members in our community with disabilities. The donations also enable us to thank the organizations that have dedicated their efforts to providing support for our residents and neighbors here in Chinatown by nourishing them with hot meals. Donations will also allow us to scale with restaurant partners to produce more hot meals, and work with local food distributors to continue providing pantry and produce essentials for recipients to nourish them for a longer period of time.Curious about the kinds of meals we make? We take the time to select ingredients that are nutritious. For one of the meals, we made a healthy brown rice porridge topped with stir-fried eggs with tomatoes and scallions, grilled oyster mushrooms, and crunchy daikon. This dish is reminiscent of what our grandparents would make in Taiwan and we wanted to provide as much comfort as there is nourishment.During the calls with the organizations, we've also learned that the general isolation and loneliness have been a critical pain point for many. As much as we want to nourish our recipients, we want to provide the same kind of sustenance for their hearts and their minds as much as we aim to with their bellies. We handwrote notes of love and support in Chinese on the to-go containers of the first 200+ meals that we cooked. We're now working closely with our community of supporters and donors and inviting them to write a handwritten letter in Chinese for us to include with each meal. If you’d love to join us, please read our Instagram post with the directions which includes our mailing address to snailmail your letters.To learn more about our original mission to work against stigma and discrimination towards our Asian community that has come hand-in-hand with the coronavirus through our postponed food tours, please read our full mission here.Thank you, most sincerely, for your generosity.

We have already sent hundreds of masks, but we need your help to do more.Why We Are Doing This:While production of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) is ramping up across America, there is acritical short-term needto deliver masks and other PPE. Doctors, nurses, and other health care providers across New York are pleading for masks. Their institutions have the money to purchase PPE, but they are unable to source the quantities they need quickly enough. Everyone in the world is rushing to buying masks and PPE, and it's extremely hard to find. We can't leave this up to hospitals and doctors to fend for themselves and hope they get what the need.To prevent the spread of COVID-19 in New York and beyond, it’s essential to take advantage of already-in-place PPE production channels. A whopping 85 percent (!) of global medical mask-production capacity has been in China since the COVID-19 outbreak — and that’s where we come in. Working on the ground in China and using our combined experience, we have sought out relationship networks with suppliers and vendors, and have volunteers to support our vetting process.But we need to act now to 1) obtain supply at a good price and 2) reserve the ever-shrinking cargo space to send masks. That's why we set this up.The Goal, and Our Plan (and Financial Stuff):$150,000, our current goal, will allow us to ship over 30,000 FDA-approved Makrite 9500 respirator masks, as well as FDA-approved 3M KN95 masks. We have located a reputable supplier in Shanghai and are spending around $4.00 mask (prices tend to fluctuate daily around this number.) Shipping express with FedEx will cost about $1.00 per mask due to high demand. The company we are dealing with will ship them directly to the United States via air freight. One caveat: subsequent shipments may change in cost (resulting in less masks) due to continuing escalation of global demand, but 100 percent of your donation will go directly toward paying for and shipping N95 masks.**Legal note: this is a personal campaign and does not necessarily represent the views of our employers.**	data/images/46733076_1587487178936188_r.jpeg

However, I'm in the north Cotswolds and another maker, Cathy, is in Plymouth. Cathy and I are both also organising for local help with our sewing. Similar schemes are now running very successfully in London and springing up elsewhere.Our aim is to keep it local and to supply to the hospitals closest by. This should make things quicker, keep costs down and ideally keep any risk of contagion to a minimum.We are liaising with hospital staff directly in the areas we live and taking advice from them about what they need, so that we can specifically help them. The nature of how the virus is spread means that the demand for scrubs is especially high.Using our professional contacts, we are buying materials at the most reasonable prices possible, but it is still quite a considerable outlay.Any donation you could make would help directly with materials - all our labour is being given for free.Should we exceed out target or there ever be any money left over, I plan to pass it on to one of the companies who have repurposed their 3D printing facilities to now make protective face shields for the NHS.	data/images/46970640_1594462248538292_r.jpeg

Many have been forced to lay employees off. Luckily, however, the federal government’s disaster relief plan included funding for small business owners.Or so we thought.As formerly incarcerated business owners, many of us were hoping the government's coronavirus rescue package would help to replace the income we all lost now that our businesses were plummeting. We attended classes to ensure we would properly submit the applications. Finally, relief was here. Until questions five and six on the form.There “it” was again. The box asking about a criminal record. The box enabling discrimination. Systemic Racism. The “it” that makes us second guess everything we do. The “it” that makes us hold our breath when we apply for housing or employment. The “it” that forced us into entrepreneurship in the first place. The ""it"" that forever makes us second-class citizens, no matter what we do.We all earn honest livings and employ other people so that they can earn honest livings as well. But the “it” canceled all the imagined success we achieved.Question 5 asked whether, within the last five years, we had been convicted of, or pled guilty or no contest to a felony, or “been placed on any form of parole or probation."" Question 6 asked whether anyone who owns at least 20% of the company was incarcerated, under indictment, or on probation or parole. If so, they are ineligible.Ineligible? When do we get to count? We were told not to apply. Some of us applied anyway, hoping we would slip through the cracks. But no luck. We were rejected. Can a formerly incarcerated person ever truly be apart of society?You cannot begin to understand what it feels like to be rejected by society even after pulling yourself up to own a business. Not only are we discriminated against, but our employees are impacted as well.Our tears and devastation are not enough to save our employees from hunger. We need help and the same resources as everyone else.Goal of the campaign:Under the existing relief plan, small business owners were eligible to receive $10,000 in relief funding, in addition to access to further loans and relief. The Formerly Incarcerated Small Business Rescue Fund is a mutual aid project that has recently formed to fill in the gap, and provide relief to formerly incarcerated small business owners.In the long term, we also want to build a network of formerly incarcerated business owners who can help to support and sustain each other, and help formerly incarcerated entrepreneurs start their own businesses. This is only the first step, and we’re grateful to all of you who will join us.LogisticsWe will use the money raised to provide grants to formerly incarcerated small business owners, who can fill out this form . The size of the grants will depend on how much money is raised. Beyond being formerly incarcerated and a small business owner, there are absolutely no restrictions on who can receive the funds. We particularly encourage formerly incarcerated Black, trans, queer, and disabled people to fill out the form.The Formerly Incarcerated Small Business Fund is a mutual aid project started by Bridgette Simpson and Denise Ruben."	data/images/48606492_1592165987394694_r.jpeg

We started helping just frontline worker but are in a position to help a lot more, we make delicious, nutritious meals to those that need it.HOW WE WORK?We have professional and experienced chefs who volunteer their time and kitchens, making meals every day for those who need it. Our meals have been delivered to hospitals, pathology clinics, hostels.We take food safety and handling very seriously, having procedures that go above and beyond requirements. We provide fresh, restaurant-quality meals, made by professional chefs in fully accredited kitchens. With combinations of wholesale and donated produce prepared by some of the chefs in the state, we are able to deliver as many high-quality meals as possible to those on the frontline of COVID-19. HOW THIS STARTED?Alex Dekker is a 20-year-old Monash University science student. When the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic hit, his life turned upside down. He was unable to go back home and visit his immunocompromised parents. During a phone called with his sister, a doctor working in the COVID-19 clinic at Monash Medical Centre, she let slip that she had nothing but a muesli bar to sustain her for her 15-hour shift. Alex decided to make a tray of lasagne for his sister. Realising there were likely many others like his sister without the same kind of support network, he posted on Facebook asking if anyone on the pandemic frontline would like some free delivered meals. After an incredible public response, this initiative grew to accommodate.WHAT IS OUR GOAL?We started to alleviate the pressure on our healthcare system, we have broadened our reach to ending food insecurity in Australia.To Contact:[email redacted]InstagramFacebookTwitter:@AlexMakesMeals	data/images/46361972_158760834761951_r.jpeg

We zijn moeders die hun kinderen verdedigen, we zijn kinderen die een toekomst willen en grootouders die opstaan voor het leven.Extinction Rebellion is de snelst groeiende geweldloze klimaat & ecologie beweging ooit. In minder dan een jaar zijn we uitgegroeid van een kleine groep mensen tot een competente en krachtige beweging die actief is in bijna 60 landen en 525 steden.Waarom we bestaanOver de hele wereld zien we de ondergang van hele ecosystemen, we zien bosbranden, extreem weer, mislukte oogsten. We bevinden ons midden in een ongekende crisis en we hebben nog maar een paar jaar om er iets aan te doen. Nederlandse rechters hebben geoordeeld dat de overheid de uitstoot van broeikasgassen drastisch dient te reduceren om haar burgers te beschermen. Toch weigert onze regering om het noodzakelijke beleid in te voeren. In plaats daarvan blijft zij de industrieën steunen en financieren die onze levens in gevaar brengen.Wat we doenWe organiseren creatieve, vreedzame en soms disruptieve acties om druk te zetten op onze regering en ze te dwingen om de nodige maatregelen te nemen tegen de klimaat- en ecologische crisis. Waarom? Omdat de geschiedenis keer op keer heeft laten zien dat burgerlijke ongehoorzaamheid een zeer effectieve manier is om radicale en snelle veranderingen tot stand te brengen.Jouw gift maakt een enorm verschilWat wij doen is voor een groot deel afhankelijk van de vrijgevigheid van donoren. Omdat we volledig worden gerund door vrijwilligers (die onvermoeibaar werken), hebben we bijna geen overheadkosten.

Meer informatie: https://extinctionrebellion.nl/---------English---------Who is Extinction Rebellion?We are a diverse group of ordinary people who are deeply concerned about the ecological crisis. We are mothers defending our children, we are children aspiring to have a future and we are grandparents rebelling for life.Extinction Rebellion is the fastest growing climate & ecology non violent direct action movement in history. In less than a year, we have grown from a small group of people, to a competent and powerful movement in almost sixty countries and 525 cities.Why we existAll across the globe we see the collapse of entire ecosystems, we see forest fires, extreme weather events, failing crops. We are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis. And we only have a few years left to do anything about it. Dutch courts have ruled that the government must drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions to keep its citizens safe. But our government is refusing to introduce the necessary policies. Instead, they are still funding and helping the very industries that are putting our lives in danger.What we doWe take creative, peaceful and sometimes disruptive action, to compel our government to take the necessary measures against the climate and ecological crisis. Why? Because history has shown time and time again that civil disobedience is a very effective way to bring about radical and fast-paced change. Your donation makes a huge differenceMost of what we do relies on the generosity of donors. Because we are completely run by volunteers (who are working tirelessly), we have little overhead costs. This means your contribution is directly used for organising bigger and more impactful actions. All donations are managed by our foundation, and directly and transparently used to:- Deliver more trainings, and grow larger- Develop and expand our communications, online and offline- Organise and promote all our actionsEvery single donation, no matter how small, is vital and very much appreciated by us.By donating you help us act for you, for your children, for the planet.

95	https://www.gofundme.com/f/garment-district-for-gowns-covid19-support-fund	Volunteer	9	Fundraiser for Garment District For Gowns by Rachel Rothenberg : Garment District for Gowns: NYC PPE Support Fund	New York, NY	Rachel Rothenberg	$70,860	$100,000	151.0	UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who has been supporting and donating to Garment District for Gowns! We started this fund to support New York City healthcare workers on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using our access to suitable fabrics, sewing skills, manufacturing experience, and most recently a partnership with the NYC Department of Health, we have distributed over 130,000 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) gowns to hospitals, nursing homes, and healthcare centers across the city, as well as to other states in need. We are committed to continuing to our work, reaching more people and supporting more communities. In addition to continuing the fight against COVID-19, Garment District for Gowns is proud to support the Black Lives Matter movement and will be directing our next round of gowns to underserved hospitals, community health centers, nursing homes and schools throughout NYC, to better support the Black community and protect those fighting at the forefront of social justice. _________________________________________________COVID-19 has afflicted more people in the United States than in any other country in the world, and New York has become the epicenter of the pandemic. As hospitals have struggled with overflow and lack of PPE, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Black and low-income communities, so the need for PPE in these communities is even greater. For months, New York City hospitals have been in dire need of more PPE to protect their staff and mitigate further spread of the disease. They’re especially hurting for masks and gowns. Fortunately, we can help - but we must act now.To accelerate this effort, we launched this Support Fund to help finance and scale the manufacturing of medical gowns, beginning with healthcare workers in New York City.WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE THESE ITEMS IN NEEDWho are we?We are a group of independent professionals in the fashion industry, with training and experience working for brands such as Ralph Lauren, Dior, Marchesa, The Row, Vera Wang, Ralph Rucci, and Oscar de la Renta. We are designers, product developers, pattern makers, and sewers, and we’re strengthened by our relationships with factories in New York City’s Garment District.We have assembled our skills and resources to help supply healthcare workers with an essential piece of protection needed on the front lines. Within our first week of launching in April, we self-financed our first batch of 300 gowns, which was sewn by 30+ volunteer sewers. Thanks to the support received via our GoFundMe campaign, we were then able to scale up manufacturing by subcontracting factories, safely bring back over 320 furloughed workers, and produce thousands of additional gowns. Throughout this process, we have stayed in close contact with Governor Cuomo’s office representatives, the FDA, the NY State Department of Health, Tri-State area hospitals, fire departments, and ambulance departments to coordinate on distribution. We need your help to continue making more gowns and scale fast.First milestone: The first batch of gowns was delivered on April 2nd to Mount Sinai Hospital, Jersey City Medical Center, Metropolitan Hospital Center, and the NY State Department of Health.Second milestone: In the interim, we have distributed PPE gowns to over 36 of the hardest hit healthcare facilities including Elmhurst Hospital, SUNY Downstate, Coney Island Hospital- Department of Emergency Medicine.Third milestone: Governor Cuomo and Empire State Development named Garment District for Gowns (GDFG) among the first grant awardees in support of the manufacturing of critically needed Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) related to the COVID-19 pandemic.WHY GOWNS?Our team is able to source the appropriate fabrics needed to make medical gowns that meet the rigorous standards of the healthcare community. Unlike face masks, which require FDA-approved filters that are harder to come by in this moment of crisis, medical gowns are made of high performance fabrics, which we are versed in handling and feel confident we can produce in batch quantities. However, continued funding is needed to maintain our output.Pictured above: Nurses at Mount Sinai West wear trash bags when left with no better alternative for protective gear, according to theNY Post.WHY NOW?COVID-19 has now afflicted more people in the United States than any other country in the world, and has disproportionately affected the Black community. Following the killing of George Floyd and many innocent Black men and women that preceded him, the GDFG will be directing their next round of gowns to medical centers and hospitals in predominantly Black communities, to better support and protect those fighting at the frontlines of social justice.According to the NYC EDC, the city currently burns through PPE gowns at a rate of 2 million gowns per week. Our aim is to make sure these gowns reach the hands of those most in need. All healthcare workers deserve equal protection.Figure 1: Slide depiction of Gov. Cuomo’s statewide equipment needs on March 27, 2020, showing the deficit of PPE in New York state. Reported by Syracuse.com.ABOUT OUR GOWNS GDFG designs and manufactures American-made, reusable, and fluid repellent medical gowns from their facilities in New York and New Jersey. Our gowns meet AAMI standards for FDA Class I- Level 2 under current EUA.The main fabric is an extra strength DWR coated (Durable Water Repellent) ripstop nylon with a polyurethane coating.The cuffs are made of a non-absorbent, polyester jersey, and ensure a secure and sealed fit at the wristThe pattern is worn with an opening in the back, like standard medical gowns. Medical workers put them on arms-first, then tie around the waist and back of the neck. Waist ties are long enough to tie in the back or front, aiding in quick application and removal.The sewers are approximately 320 talented individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, whom we are proud to have brought back from being furloughed.Figure 2 : See above photos of one of our finished gowns.WHO WE ARERachel Rothenberg-Saenz is a graduate of Parsons School of Design who most recently works as Head of Product Design & Development for Oscar de la Renta.

Should we raise excess funds and supplies, we hope to expand our donations to other hospitals in need.FAQsAre donations tax deductible? Currently, donations are not tax-deductible. We are in a process of filing a 501(c)(3) charity and will update our status as soon as possible. What goes into producing these gowns?Garments are produced by hand, by real individuals in the USA! After design and technical development they will pass through the hands of those at fabric mills, trucking companies, cutting rooms, sewing, finishing and packaging lines. Each contractor manages their employees, logistics and overhead in this team effort.Aside from donations, how can you help? We are seeking:> Fabric donations (subject to close scrutiny)> Company partnerships for services or goods in need (for example, Ziploc has generously supplied us with cartons of bags to pack each individual gown in)What’s next?In addition to continuing the first against COVID-19, Garment District for Gowns is proud to support the Black Lives Matter movement and will be directing our next round of gowns to medical centers and hospitals nearest to the protest lines.

I'm one of the founders of Boloco and Worthee (and B.Good too back in the day!). The mission of Boloco is to positively impact the lives and futures of our people and communities through bold and inspired food and practices. The mission of Worthee is to use technology to help people in low wage jobs to rise and thrive. WHO WE ARE SUPPORTING:I've spent my career trying to use business to better peoples' lives, and thanks to encouragement of a few dozen friends afterI posted a video asking for some support, this GoFundMe page was created and is accepting donations from people near and far who want to contribute to our Feed the Frontline campaign. WHAT'S #FEEDTHEFRONTLINE ALL ABOUT?During the COVID-19 crisis period, all items at Boloco are priced at $5 or less* - to accomplish this we've streamlined our menu significantly, but the benefit is that for those still working every day, our food is simple, delicious, safe, quick and as importantly affordable! We named it our #feedthefrontline effort, which only a couple of weeks later is a pretty widely used, but nonetheless important, term.YOUR DONATION:Every $5 you donate directly provides a burrito or a bowl to feed hospital workers, civil servants, police, fire, and other restaurant and essential workers who are out on the frontline. As an example, if you donate $50, that means 10 meals will be provided to the frontline organization of your choice or, if you prefer, our choice... in Greater Boston area as well as in the Upper Valley of NH/VT.The food will be delivered to appropriate organizations beginning Monday, March 30, 2020 and we will continue to do so until the funds have been fully depleted.Please email us if you have any questions at [email redacted]. Grateful for the opportunity to contribute.

This is Urgent.We must take action to protect as many Dreamers and their families as possible. When Dreamers are able to renew their applications, they are likely protected for another two years.Two more years at home with their families. Two more years of security. DACA has allowed 750,000 young people to attend college, embark on careers, purchase homes, raise families, and live without the fear of deportation. When President Obama enacted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in June 2012, he stated, “These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper.” The clock is ticking. Dreamers make our collective future brighter for their being part of it. Thank you for your support. All funds raised will directly support DACA recipients and their families.The Immigration Institute of the Bay Area (IIBA) is a 102-year-old nonprofit that helps immigrants, refugees, and their families join and contribute to the community.IIBA’s legal team has submitted over 300 DACA renewal applications since shelter in place.	data/images/48854510_1592263413726899_r.jpeg

It has been on my mind since the death of my beloved grandfather in 2007. After thirteen years of wishing, I have the chance to make it come true.My grandparents were named Arthur and Annie Stone, and they were the children of sharecroppers. They too were sharecroppers until the 1960s, when they were able to purchase their farm outright. They raised three daughters there, including my mama.When Papa died, Nanny could not run the farm on her own, and my mom and her sisters made the choice to sell it. I was 17 at the time, and the longing for that farmhouse with the dark green shutters has stayed on my shoulders all these years since.Simply put: I am going to try to buy it back. Miraculously, the current owner is looking to sell it.This is the one chance I’ll ever have to do this.For me, the story begins in 1995, the first of countless times I remember piling in the car with my siblings and parents, driving the three and a half hours from Atlanta, GA, to Nanny and Papa’s house in Petersburg, TN. This farmhouse was where we spent countless happy Thanksgivings, Christmases, and summer holidays.But for Arthur and Annie stone, the story starts 150 years before that. To the period just after the American Civil War called Reconstruction.Quick history lesson if you need one: Agriculture was the economic force of the Southern United States, and the enslavement of people descended from stolen Africans kept the economy afloat. After the enslaved became freedmen, General Sherman proposed that the land seized from former Confederates should be divided among the freedmen, as repayment for their treatment.This is commonly referred to as Forty Acres and a Mule, and it was a promise that wasn’t kept. Instead, the land was returned to the former Confederates who previously owned it.The land needed to be worked. And there was an entire population -- only recently considered citizens in their own right -- who needed work and food and security. Enter: sharecropping.Sharecropping was an exploitative model. It worked like this: a tenant would live on and work a portion of a landowner’s plantation, farm, or land. In exchange, that tenant kept a (usually small) portion of the crop come harvest time.Sharecroppers had very little agency. They didn’t own their own equipment, they were forced to accept the prices the landowners were willing to pay, and if they stuck up for themselves they risked their livelihood and family home.In the last years of her life, Nanny told me that she had taken to being pen pals with the son of the landowner she sharecropped for. He apologized for the ways he and his family had wronged my grandparents. It is no small feat that these people -- my people -- born not even 60 years after the dissolution of slavery, broke the mold of their families and somehow overcame admitted wrongdoing. That feels like another miracle.If all I ever accomplished in my life was buying back my grandparents’ farm and restoring it to something they would be proud of, that would be enough. I want to live a life where my siblings and our children can go back there for holidays. I want my mama to spend more Thanksgivings or Christmases there in her life.So I am asking you to please help me get my ancestral home back. I would appreciate anything you can contribute. And if you are not in a position to donate, all I ask is that you share the link to this campaign with everyone you can think of.Nanny and Papa spent their entire lives in the picturesque state of Tennessee; living through the roaring twenties, the great depression, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement, and so much more.Their lives make up the history of that land. It’s now on me to determine the future of it.Thank you for your help.	data/images/48717446_1591806497867196_r.jpeg

He was travelling from his newly built home from Griffin, North of Brisbane to his family. He was cleaning the new home to get the delivery of some household appliances on Wednesday and move in over the weekend.The accident was caused by a stolen car travelling north bound in the south bound lane on the Gympie Arterial running into innocent Shahid’s car. Paramedics confirmed that Shahid lost his life on the spot.Shahid has been living in Australia and been calling Brisbane home for almost 10 years now. He’s a very polite and humble person, who worked hard to fulfil his Australian dream of building his home and raising his kids in this beautiful country.Unfortunately, he left this world before he could spend a night in his new home. He’s a left his wife and son with a huge mortgage and many more uncertainties.The wider Brisbane communities have been heavily impacted by this tragic incident. But they have come together and shown great support towards the deceased’s family. Neighbours of his new house at Griffin have left flowers and toys for little Saahir (4 years old). The messages have touched the wife and helping her to get stronger.As friends and community members we’re reaching out to you all to help them worry about one less thing.

While we fared better than most, we have also experienced great loss. Our beloved canal house (photo) is completely destroyed; my dad’s fishing boat, the “OK” was flipped upside down across the canal; my brother’s home is roofless and has sustained tremendous water damage; and lastly, our little two bedroom home lost part of the roof and has also sustained a lot of water damage. This little home, which has become an open house to anyone that needs a bed (rescue workers, medics and other family friends) or a meal, has been command central for our rebuilding efforts. My parents have not left Treasure Cay since this all has transpired and have been tirelessly working on putting our home back together again. My brother, who was instrumental in getting information out of Treasure Cay and ensuring everyone’s safety in the days right after Dorian, had to be evacuated a week after the storm. He was given the all clear after a hospital visit and is now recovering in FL. He has continued helping with relief efforts and has been taking care of family and friends that have arrived in FL from Abaco.If you know my family, you know how hard it is for us to ask for or to accept any kind of help... but unfortunately, we have come to a point where we no longer can rebuild all of it on our own. Through all of this, the one thing that can be said of my parents, Hank and Andrea, as well as my brother, Christoph, is that they are the backbone of Treasure Cay and have all shown strength beyond measure. They make me proud to be an Albury as well as a Bahamian (with a touch of German).Albury Strong.Please note that our long time family friend and US citizen, Susan Slaff , will be assisting with retrieving funds and ensuring my parents and brother receive these ASAP. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.	data/images/41910256_1568410712626931_r.jpeg

We have submitted a cash offer to the bank and they have countered at a much higher number than we anticipated - it looks like capitalism isn’t going to let this land come home without a fight. We are preparing to do battle and are raising our goal to 100k. We refuse to give up on this freedom dream and hope you will join us in our struggle to return this land to Black stewardship!—We met our goal of $50,000! We did it! Thank you so much everybody. We are raising our goal to $70,000 in case there is a counter-offer + to support needed repairs. Thank you for keeping the love flowing!We are raising the funds to buy back a house that sits on Carlin's people's land. It was sold some 48 years ago, and today: it is for sale. We must move swiftly to obtain the necessary funds and return this land to the Black family who have stewarded it for generations.Please write the organizers for more detailed info on sending large donations via wire transfer <3---Update from Carlin on July 4 + photos of the land:The outpouring of support has been so great I am beside myself. In less than 24 hours we are almost halfway to our goal to reacquire this land. For all who have given and for all who are considering, we say thank you from the bottom of hearts for being willing to support our freedom dreams. My family and I are blown away. With your support I hope to place an offer on the property in the next 72 hours.We are looking forward to creating a safe space for our people (TGNC, Queer, BIPOC organizers, artists, teachers, healers and those who might just need to get loved on for a while) to come rest, dream, and strategize. We are trusting and believing that this is possible. We are trusting and believing that we will be able to pour even more love back into this home that has held us. Stewardship and love was my grandparents’ vision for this land and that is my goal. ---Carlin's words:There is a patch of land in North Carolina where freedom grows. The seeds were planted by my grandfather's hands over 70 years ago and have been nurtured by my family each generation since.As a child I would look out and over what he had held for us for so long and picture the unspeakable acts of terror bestowed upon the land by white men washed away by the unimaginable strength and goodness and love that my family soaked back into the earth year after year.In this time many of us find ourselves wondering what it means to find home, to fight for freedom and to hold onto it by any means necessary. This moment holds more truth and possibility and bitterness than we could have ever collectively imagined. This moment also holds within it a possibility for a return to the land.There is a house, a tired and seen many-a-thing house that sits on the land my grandfather planted those freedom seeds on. It was removed from my family's possession 48 years ago, and today - it is for sale.It is no small thing to be called to a place. It is a larger thing still to let myself hope that there is a possibility of return. As a Black Queer southern organizer, fighting for the freedom of my people is my birthright. I am seeking a reclamation of what it means to be free and am reaching out to you for support in realizing it.We have a limited amount of time to raise the money required to bring the house and the land home again. I am humbly asking for those who feel called, to give what you are able. In making this request of my community I am fighting against losing hope.Any and everything would be a blessing.In the greatest love,Carlin	data/images/49318558_1593694872353707_r.jpeg

Years that we spent living very carefully to save for our golden years, clipping coupons, and budgeting more than the average person with our income so that we would have a nice Nest Egg when we retired. However, without my knowledge, my now ex-husband wasted ALL of our retirement Nest Egg (close to 1 million) on day trading, without telling me about the losses until it was all gone and we were deep in credit card debt. Then he took up with Nigerian scams and related romance scams, and I found myself newly-divorced, penniless, and starting over at close to 70 years old. I'm now in my seventies and with the grace of God, I have been able up until now, to work 40 hours a week standing on my feet as a cashier trying to make ends meet. However, when I can no longer work I do not know how I will survive, as my social security is a bare minimum. I am already having greater and greater difficulty meeting my full-time schedule. Meanwhile, my ex continues to send thousands of dollars to what he believes are young rich beautiful women who are going to marry him and turn over a fortune to him. And he says he is doing it all for me! When Jill & I realized my ex was endangering himself by sleeping outside to have more money to send to these women, we made a last-ditch effort to wake him up to what he was doing. We hoped that seeing the patterns of the lies of the scammers who are taking his money all lined up together would make him realize he needs to change his behavior.When it became obvious that he was not going to listen or change at all, people suggested a GoFundMe.If I could buy a modest house I could hope to survive my last years without facing life on the streets. So here is my plea. My ex-husband's stubborn determination to continue his irrational behavior, combined with rapidly rising rents, greedy landlords and increased regulations on qualifying for apartments are creating a situation that will eventually result in my having to, at an advanced age, resort to living in my car. Please help me get a modest house so that I can live out my last years with a roof over my head. For those that feel moved to contribute or help I am deeply humbled and grateful and I am blown away by the generosity of others. I thank the Lord for this incredible opportunity to tell my story and hope that it will change others' lives as well. Note that I have modified my location to protect some very private people. Sincerely, Jeremi"	data/images/43594774_1597702132107826_r.jpeg

He has a larger-than-life personality, and no one can “work the room” like him. He loves the Pats and the Sox, but neither compare to the love he has for his wife, Andrea of 27 years. Tim and Andrea have 4 wonderful children & 2 beautiful grandchildren, who they continue to support every day. His love for life and family is a reflection on his parents, Bob & Debbie, as well as all of his siblings, Mike, Pat, Johnno and Erin. His zest for having a good time make him the life of any party or gathering. He immediately connects with anyone he encounters.Tim has continued to keep a positive attitude and a smile for nearly 4 years of battling. He and Andrea would like to personally thank all of their friends and family that have continued to support them through this tough time.

To recap, I was watching the news late Sunday night, got moved by Emily’s story and went to gofundme to chip in, noticed no account had been set up when I entered her first and last name - so decided to do one myself. Went to sleep, woke up and it was nearly at $1,000 and growing. As more attention to Emily’s story occurred the donations kept coming in - from the media accounts I have seen her life has taken a turn for the positive and on my end it has been very intense.  I have received hundreds of emails and FB requests/questions which totally makes sense, but I am no expert in this and like you, I just want the best for Emily so she can get back on her feet and live her life. I live in LA, but have never met Emily. Currently, LA Councilman Joe Buscaino’s office has been communicating with her and they know my goal is to give Emily control of this account when she is ready for it. I haven’t touched any of the money, nor will I ever.  Because Emily is homeless communication between her and I hasn’t been simple so going through the councilman’s office has served our purposes for now.For all the folks who have e-mailed me about donating a violin, housing, a job for her those emails have been saved and when Emily is ready she can read each one and go from there. Because I don’t represent her, it wouldn’t be fair to move forward on any of these offers without her permission/involvement and blessing. I believe we will be making contact soon, so this account can go from a random person who created it to helping Emily no longer be homeless and giving her everything she needs, including her violin. From what I can tell she has gotten A LOT of press attention, so she is sort of busy I take it.Also know the folks at GoFundMe and I communicate several times a day - they have been great, the support of everyone donating has been amazing. This situation that I have gotten myself into has been really interesting and a learning experience just navigating all of this. So thank you for the emails, questions and advice from everyone, and one last thing between the two largest GoFundMe accounts set up - donors have given over $100,000 earmarked to change Emily’s life forever! Thank you.	data/images/42384160_1569824014840181_r.jpeg

Steven suffered a severe spinal cord injury in his c6/c7 vertebrae. Steven was transported to Waterford University Hospital where they realised how serious his injuries were and then from Waterford he got a garda escort by Ambulance to The Spinal Injuries Unit in the Mater Hospital in Dublin. The gifted and what can only be described as Angels of a medical team operated on him the following day and he spent 12 hours in surgery, they told us it was the worst spinal injury that they have ever seen and that he was lucky he wasn't killed on impact.This injury has left him at 24 years of age as a Quadriplegic which also brings with this type of injury a lot more medical conditions such as Dysreflexia,no bladder or bowel control and his chest is very weak which leaves him very high risk to infections. He will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Steven has never stopped fighting for his life, overcoming obstacles and continuing to prove his strength everyday. His rehabilitation journey was long and hard and with the help of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dublin he is now ready to return home but it is with a great financial cost to do so.Steven will require specialist equipment, and specialised care and support for a long time and most likely forever. Steven is currently in a wonderful caring Nursing Home in Clarinbridge Co. Galway as the family are working hard to get him home. The cost to get him home is tens of thousands as the home needs to be completely adapted to his needs and this does not include purchasing a wheelchair adapted van for him. We are trying to raise funds to ease the financial burden on his family. So Saturday the 18th of July I and some of Stevens family members undertook a challenge to walk from Roscrea Co. Tipperary to the top of Devils Bit in Templemore Co. Tipperary and back to Roscrea a total of 52km while pushing a wheelchair right to the top of The Devils Bit. Steven also a did the 52k on the same day on his Rowing Machine for his arms in the nursing home that day.We have kept this go fund me open because we are pushing to get Simmo home to all of us and we need all the help we can get. Steven has spoke about his experience on the Ryan Tubridy Show Tuesday 11th August and we are so happy that people got to know Steven like we do, Positive, Caring and Loving.If anyone can donate to this I would be truly grateful no matter how big or small. Also share this link with people who may be able to support the funding effort.Lets Push for Simmo to come home. Thank you	data/images/49418720_1594039312772647_r.jpg

Gyanchand (Gyan, Gyani) passed away after an excruciating but very brave two year battle with cancer. He lived an exemplary life by guiding peers and juniors in many ways. He also cared deeply for people in need, both within and outside his circle of acquaintances. Gyan was close to so many of us and his memories will be cherished forever.Gyan is survived by his wife Rachana and 2 kids, Vibha (9 years) and Laksh (5 years). Currently, Rachana and kids have emotional support of family, friends and Gyanchand's colleagues. However, Rachana has been a housewife throughout. We strongly felt that financial help is necessary to deal with the loss. In memory of Gyan and with his family's approval, we have created this GoFundMe page. All proceeds will go directly to Rachana to help them in the near future and in times to come.Please continue to keep Mehta family in your prayers.Case for financial help:While Gyan had health coverage through the employer, Gyan had mentioned that family has substantial out-of-pocket expenses that is yet to be paid. Gyan did not want any help towards paying those bills. As Rachana has been a house-wife so far, we feel that the money raised will be needed to support the family, especially kids' education.More about Gyanchand's battle with cancer:Gyanchand was diagnosed with Myeloid Dysplasia in April of 2018. The alarmingly low RBC, platelet, and WBC counts meant that he was in grave danger and needed multiple blood transfusions every week. He underwent harsh chemotherapy regimen for many months while managing medical complications such as high blood pressure, fistula and appendicitis. To deal with the pain and emotional toll, he sought the refuge of books, meditation, pranayama (breathing control) and conversations with friends. He underwent what looked to be successful bone marrow transplant in February 2019. The bone marrow biopsy results also meant that he was 'cancer-free' for practical purposes. The donor cells were also producing blood cells in a satisfactory manner. However, he started suffering from multi-organ GVHD which ultimately became debilitating. Clinical management of GVHD became quite challenging with viral flares and other complications. Even with all these, Gyan managed to find new clients in his consultancy role and always looked forward to work. Finally, with fungal sinusitis and pneumonia, doctors felt that only miracles could save him. Gyan refused ICU care and wanted to improve his condition sheerly by his Will Power. He spent his last days contacting many friends and being with his close family and friends. His body finally succumbed with a rupture in the lungs.More about Gyanchand:Gyanchand was a fun living and easy-going person. He sought and nurtured friendships. He took a lot of satisfaction from guiding acquaintances in matters of his expertise. His humanity knew no bounds. He was especially passionate about financial matters: financial literacy, financial freedom, financial prudence etc. He was a voracious reader, always on the look out for emerging trends of the world.Originally from India, Gyan held a high regard for entrepreneurial, industrious, and innovative work culture prevalent in the USA. Similarly, he was in awe of elite universities of the land. He was very keen to ensure that his kids get the best higher education that they can possibly get.	data/images/44250614_1576944135386112_r.jpeg

My mom and dad moved to San Francisco from China for a better life 35+ years ago. They gave birth and raised 3 children and worked EVERYDAY SINGLE DAY. Weekends included. My dad is a retired licensed general contractor. And my mom is an extremely loved and trusted house keeper.Fast forward 35 years of blood sweat and tears. At around 12 noon today, their entire life savings was gone in a less than 15 minute breaking-and-entering. We spent the entire day speaking with police and trying to ""not touch anything"" because CSI needs to go through the stuff first. I can only imagine the anxiety they had sitting there not allowed to check what was missing from their bedroom.Just like most traditional Asian families, cash is king, and my parents kept their life savings as cash inside a safe they had hidden away. My heart sunk when I discovered they had so much cash in there but what broke it wasn't losing their life savings. They had purchased three sets of jewelry as wedding gifts, one for each of their children. My brother and I are married so there was one set left in there, for my sister. I was translating this to the police when my mom repeated herself. I snapped at my mom, ""you said that already."" She responded, ""no, there's two sets in there, one is your sister's and the other was given for your dad and my wedding from your grandmother."" I choked as I was translating this part and I can see the officer started getting teary eyed too...I hate that these guys perpetuate the stereotype of who we think are criminals. However, if you're in the SF bay area please keep your eyes out for the two African American men in the pictures above. License plate picture was sent to us from a neighbor but was too hard to make anything of it. Anyone with information please message me or contact the Ingleside police station. The officer said these guys also hit another home in a nearby neighborhood 2 hours earlier. They also said that it's a good thing my parents weren't home because these guys don't care if there's someone home.Even after all this my dad said, ""at least they didn't take the money we earned today."" That's right, even after all this my dad was able to see the bright side. And yes, he's retired but he still works for clients who have become close family friends.*This is our first gofundme, please forgive the goal amount I have no idea what it's supposed to signify so it's just an arbitrary number, I've changed it a couple times because people convinced me 1000 was too little etc etc.. to be honest we don't expect to fully recover the amount lost but every little bit helps.*The money will go to replacing the stolen items including passports, birth certificates/naturalization documents, repairs and the rest will be to restart their retirement funds (in a bank account this time.) I have direct access to my parents banking information so there will be no trouble getting the funds into their hands."	data/images/49841074_1595401642725084_r.jpeg

Just prior to Christmas, their family home burnt to the ground, and a technicality with their insurance policy has meant that they had no cover and hence no money to cover the demolition and rebuild.The Claxton’s had no other option than to move in with relatives over the Christmas Period whilst trying get together their lives back in order and make plans as to how they could finance a new home.All the while still paying a mortgage on a property completely destroyed.Michael and Marelka have been doing it very tough but not once did either of them complain, they were just so happy that no one was hurt and that they still had their beautiful family.Just this Thursday , I received a call saying that Michael Claxton had died suddenly at the age of 37 from a heart attack whilst interstate on a business trip.His wife and three small children all under the age of 10 now don’t have a home or their husband and father.Michael was a small business owner of Apex Scaffolding in Adelaide, and his family relied purely on his business to support the household.This has rocked many people, Family, staff and all associated with Michael and his family.Michael and the Claxton family, are the most generous and giving people that ever lived on this planet. When you were in trouble Mick was there. If you weren't in trouble, Mick would check in to make sure you going ok.Michael helped so many people out in times of despair and need. So it's time to pay it forward.We have set a goal of $100,000 to purchase the materials in order to rebuild their home. The labour is going to be donated through friends through from building industry, we just need the dollars for the materials.The aim is to put a roof over this family’s head in this time of grief and despair and get them back on their feet. They will never replace their Husband & Father, but a place to call home would be an amazing start.All donations will go to the Claxton family, and contribute towards rebuilding their family home.Any donation, no matter the size will be appreciated, and we hope to get the Claxton Family back on their feet	data/images/45353254_1581408825468244_r.jpeg

Thanks to friends in Alaska, he has the opportunity to run the race with an eager team of dogs, but getting to the start line involves expenses far beyond what's typically required for day-to-day mushing. We can only do it with your support.Estimated costs involved in running the race can easily be $60,000. Two wonderful sponsors in Texas (thank you, Heather and Susan!) have kicked off Quince's entry expense and given us the confidence to try this wild thing. Quince has already entered two mid-distance races in AK this winter to ready himself for the race. Team BraverMountain is excited to get to Nome, but first we need to get to Anchorage. Will you help us meet our goal of entering Quince in the 2020 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race? Forward!Blair (and Quince)BraverMountain MushingNOTE: Last year, we offered tee shirt incentives for those who contributed $60 or more to Blair's race (as well as drawings to win shirts for those who contributed any amount). The response was wonderful, but managing this endeavor through GoFundMe (and trying to ship during the training season) proved a bit complicated, as this platform isn't set up well for incentives.This year, we would like to simplify things and be as inclusive as we can. If we are able to meet our financial goal for Iditarod expenses, we will offer our limited edition Idita-merch (tees and hoodies) very nearly AT COST (saving a little to account for mistakes and pay design contributors of course); they will be high quality and inexpensive. If we meet 80% of our goal this week, team calendars will sell for under $15 as well.BIG NOTE: Look what we did in 2019! #uglydogs 	data/images/43821468_1575340821562010_r.jpeg

Charles aspired to becoming a Detroit Police Officer but before he actively pursued that career path, he decided to first give back so joined Michigan's Army National Guard in March of 2014. He signed up, took his oath, and was waiting to ship off to boot camp.On June 1 st, 2014 Charles’ life changed. He was gunned down in a drive-by shooting while visiting his cousin a block away from Central High School. As a result, Charles was paralyzed from the waist down. And on that day, a young man with big dreams of serving others pretty much lost his freedom.Charles didn’t give up, though. He was learning to live his life as a paraplegic and was being cared for by his mother, Carolyn Young. On the night of April 1 st, 2016, Carolyn Young was killed in a hit-and-run traffic collision; a speeding Dodge Challenger slammed into her Nissan Altima, pinning her inside and ultimately killing her not far from the family home she shared with her husband, daughter Brandy, and son Charles. I remember that night well; Charles and I were already friends.The Day Charles Mother, Carolyn Young, Was KilledApril Fool’s day, 2016 is the day life drastically changed for Charles. With his mother and primary care giver gone, there was no one able to lift and carry Charles down the stairs of their rented flat, a home they had been in for many years, long before Charles was shot. Charles’ father, with medical conditions stemming from diabetes, simply isn't able to help.As a result, Charles became trapped in a 2nd floor flat, unable to leave unless the State of Michigan and Medicaid deemed it essential. Ambulance costs with lift assist down a flight of stairs can and often cost over $2,600 dollars per round trip. Medicaid does approve visits to an emergency room in an emergency, but for visits to a dentist, routine doctor’s office visits, etc., that cost is often left up to Charles. Charles monthly income? $968.00 a month.Finding Section 8 housing in Detroit is extremely difficult; the wait times are often over 5 years. An attempt was made to find new housing, but there wasn't much help available and Charles’ needs went unanswered and to this day they continue to go unanswered.Undeterred, Charles spent the next 4 years pursuing an education; an education online because he can't leave the second-floor flat. Charles has graduated twice in 4 years; once with an associate of arts degree in general business, and again with an associate of arts degree in business IT. He was just accepted to another online school, Northwood University, to pursue a bachelor’s degree in business. Charles is determined.So, you ask, why am I starting this GoFundMe account for Charles? Well, I want Charles to be free. See, we often take life for granted, you and me. We're able to go to the store, movies, restaurants, parties or just visit our backyards to enjoy a sunny afternoon or cool evening.Charles can't. Not that Charles doesn't want to, but he can't. He's trapped in a 2nd floor flat, in a tough part of Detroit, with the same view, day in and day out. He can't tell if it's sunny outside unless he looks out the window. He's a prisoner in his own home and has been a prisoner for 4 years.We're looking to provide Charles a safe, accessible, and comfortable home. Charles sister, Brandy, received a scholarship to Michigan State University through hard work and determination; she's soon to graduate and we're looking to give her a place to visit her family, to enjoy a cool evening with Charles in the backyard. We're looking to remove the obstacles life has placed in Charles path; obstacles that prevent him from enjoying even the most simple things: the ability to seek medical help without going bankrupt, the ability to take his education and make something of his incredible life, to work and take care of himself. We're looking to right the wrongs society has done to Charles. This 26-year-old man from Detroit has experienced the worst life has to offer. I'd like you to look back in your own life and remember the times someone helped you. That help may have been a small gesture or a big gesture, but it made a difference in your life. I certainly can remember such times in mine.Your gesture of generosity will help us in achieving our goal. It may be small, it may be large, but a gesture is a gesture. After all, the only thing we leave behind in life is our good deeds.Thank you,John RobertsVideo of Charles Blackwell being interviewed by WXYZ Channel 7 Reporter Jennifer Ann Wilson	data/images/47583172_1587577601762224_r.jpeg

It was a picture perfect night, so Kevin and Brendan went down to South Kingston town beach for an evening swim. While out in the water, a set of large waves came in and Kevin–being who he is–took the challenge and caught the wave body surfing. The wave crashed on a very shallow part of the beach, and Kevin was thrown head-first into the shore. Brendan was headed out behind him and noticed that he was face down in the water, and hurried to pull him out of the water.When he was brought back to shore, they were able to get Kevin to cough up the water he had ingested and get him breathing again. Kevin was conscious, but unable to move his arms or legs. Immediately, a group of people gathered at the scene and circled in prayer around him. This amazing system of support created a very intense spiritual experience for everyone at the beach that evening.Kevin was evacuated from the beach on a backboard and transferred to Rhode Island Hospital that night. The initial x-ray showed no fractures in the spinal column, but the MRI confirmed that he does have damage to his spinal cord (C3-C-5, hemorrhage in C5). Kevin had a surgery to remove a portion of his vertebrae bone to release pressure and allow extra space for some swelling to occur.Kevin has an incomplete spinal cord injury and is a quadriplegic. However, it is possible, and it is his goal, that he will someday walk again, he will hug his grandchildren, and he will regain feeling in his hands and legs. This will be a process and will take lots of hard work and time. He has began his journey down the long road to recovery, making slow but steady progress each day. In early August, he was transferred to Gaylord Rehabilitation Hospital in Wallingford, CT, where is continues his full-time rehabilitation regiment.We have initiated this fundraiser to help cover Kevin's needs and tools for success as he transitions from life in the inpatient rehabilitation hospital to life outside the hospital. These needs will include a new means of transportation, home modifications (ramps, etc.), and other tools that will help make it easier for Kevin to get back to living a normal life at home.Your support is greatly appreciated by Kevin and the entire Haggerty Family!	data/images/41584836_1566829429356828_r.jpeg

My name is Candace Jennifer and since 2014 I have had one dream; to open a BIPOC-centered urban farm and wholeness center in Winooski, VT.

Granddaughter to Frank, Dorothy, Jewel and Goldbourne.Sister to Adrian, Leisa, Maurice, Kevin, Kenson and Karreell.I am mother to David Justus.I am life-partner to Tony.As a child of colonization,many of my ancestors names remain unknown to me because they were displaced from Africa in the TransAtlantic slave trade. Our families broken apart; our connection to the land of our lineage severed. Yet, these ancestors are not lost to me, they live in me, breathe through me, guide me, teach me, nourish me. In turn I honor them by prioritizing and dedicating myself to the practice of midwifing these ancient bonds that make me Candace.Some of my ancestors names are unknown to me because they were likely the ones who stole, raped, enslaved and murdered my African ancestors; ripping us from our lands and families in pursuit of greed and false power. Yet these ancestors are also not lost to me, they too live in me, breathe through me, guide and teach me. In turn I honor them by alchemizing their lineage of toxic oppression and transform it into a new path for justice, healing, resistance and love.I am a servant and steward of nature; some may want to call me witch, bruja, shamaness, healer, herbalist, urban farmer or homesteader. For me, so many of these words, titles, labels don’t completely resonate like servant and steward of nature. My relationship with the land and its rhythms is a birthright that I humbly nurture as I observe the land both outside and within me.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Education:Master’s degree in Interdisciplinary Education from University of Vermont(graduated with honors, Pi Gamma Mu)Bachelor’s degree in American Studies & Education from Smith CollegeAdvanced Yoga Studies, 300 HR, from Hathavidya in Classical Hatha YogaYoga Certification200 HR, from Laughing River Yoga in Hatha YogaHolistic Health Coach Certification from Hathavidya Inner Harmony ProgramReiki Certification, Level 2, from Reiki Master Anne CameronHealing Touch Certification, Level 1, from University of VermontLabor & Birth/Postpartum Doula CertificationRadical Herbal Allyship Program* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Professional Experience:Over 15 years in Higher Education - Undergraduate Admissions, Student Affairs and Diversity & EquityOver 10 years in Food - Customer Service, Personal Chef, Food Education & Mentorship, Catering, Holistic Health Coaching, Permaculture, Urban Farming & Homesteading, Produce Manager, Farm-to-School Chef, Line Cook, Prep Cook, Senior Cook, Head Chef.Over 20 years in Social Justice - Community Organizing, Advocacy, Education & Training, Outreach, Board WorkOver 15 years in Trauma - Gender-Based & Sexual Violence, Rape Culture, Anti-Oppression, Healing	data/images/49491282_1594238042716257_r.jpeg

As many of you may be aware from the news and our social media campaigns, because of the necessary steps of taken to keep the public safe during the Covid-19 Pandemic, our restaurants, like so many others in our community and the greater hospitality community beyond have been shut down and are in economic crisis mode and on the verge of collapsing.This is not easy for me. I am used to being the one who shows up to support and raise money for charitable causes, and others in need. For the last 18 years it has been the greatest honor of my life to cook for and serve so many of you at Nicks on Broadway. Using food and hospitality we've strived to build and cultivate community, teamwork, and togetherness while serving you all. It has brought me, my family and our team immeasurable pride, incredible memories and experiences as we have broken bread with and shared so many special meals and moments with you all over the years.With the onset of this health scare and the massive impact it has had on our family and small business, I am facing the brutal reality that we may not be able to continue on. I know that these are challenging and difficult times for everyone, and so many people are in need and out of work and deserving of your support and attention. But as hard as this is to ask, I am responsible for over 50 people whom I care deeply about and who count on me, so I am here, humbled, at your grace and mercy to ask for your help to save our restaurant and afford us the opportunity to continue the work of providing for our staff and serving you and our community. This is such an incredibly hard thing to do. Any support that you can give is important and appreciated, nothing is too small.It is my goal that with your support we will be able to:- Ensure that we canstay open by helping with operating costs we are unable to- Create financial relief for my staff that have lost their jobs due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisisWe are also offering free or heavily discounted take out meals to:- Our staff while they are out of work- Children K-12- Medical professionals in our community- Hospitality workers in our communityThe funds that we raise will also help offset the cost of providing these free and discounted meals.My goal is to continue operations in a Take Out capacity and create the opportunity to reemploy as many of our staff as possible as quickly as possible and continue providing food for our community during this time even if it is unprofitable to do so. If you don't have the means to donate I would ask that you please call and write your Senators, Congressman, Mayor and the Governor to express the need for real and immediate relief for the hospitality workers and small businesses during this unprecedented disaster, else so many of our restaurants, cafés and bars you love may not be there much longer.On behalf of my family and our restaurant family, I thank you for your support during this most difficult time.Sincerely and with the deepest gratitude, Derek Wagnerowner and chef of nicks on broadway[email redacted]	data/images/46356404_1584852903426154_r.jpeg
